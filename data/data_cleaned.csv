"Hey everyone,

I've been wondering if there's a way to dynamically share types between programming languages, almost like how Prisma allows you to change the schema locally and update a central database that can be picked up by a different application.

Specifically, I'm wondering if there's a tool or framework out there that would allow me to define my types in one language (e.g. TypeScript) and have those types automatically generated in another language (e.g. Python) without needing to manually write out the same types in both languages.

Does anyone know of anything like this? Or am I just dreaming up something that doesn't exist?

"Hey! I'm a product owner looking for some advice about RBAC: CRUD vs read/write permissions.

Context: large scale, multitenant platform with a buttload of permissions and deals with a lot of regulations / sensitive data.

We're designing our authorization system and I'm going back and forth with tech leadership. There are two options we're between. Example for each option where the object being given permissions to manage is a ""product"":

Product: read/write
Delete product: read/write
If role has product - r/w they can read, create, update a product
If role has delete product - r/w they can see delete button and delete a product

OR

Product: create, read, update, delete
If role has product - create they can create a product
If role has product - delete they can delete a product
Etc

I'm looking for advice which option to use. I'll keep my opinion to myself. I'm hoping to understand the pros and cons of each design pattern.

Thank you!

"We have a scenario at work. We use OIDC and Google OAUTH to enable users sign in with their google account. The initial scopes on the access token are limited. Along the line in the app flow, if users want to create meetings with other users, we ask users to add new scopes to their access token with an ""add your google calendar"" button, we then store the user's calendar ID in the backend &amp; the access token (which we store on the frontend) has updated scopes to interact with the google calendar API. Now, if a user signs out, we delete these tokens from the frontend. But if a user re logs in, the ""Add google calendar"" button will not be displayed because on our Frontend, we check to see if a calendar is associated with the user in the db and since the user has added their calendar before, the button doesnt show. The issue is, the access token now doesnt have the calendar scope on it since it is a new login and hence the meeting creation fails due to ""insufficient scope"", how best can I handle this situation?",SoftwareEngineering,1025,192

"Hi Folks, 

I’m a software engineer with just under 7 years experience in industry. I primarily develop backend systems in Java / Kotlin, primarily for container based usage in the cloud. Most of the systems I design are event based, so lots of times I stand up Kafka and other messaging systems via docker for local development. I also have an interest in mobile development, primarily in Kotlin Native at the moment, but I’d like to look at alternatives. However the mobile work is purely personal L&amp;D.

I have a MacBook Pro that I have through work, but there’s no option to use that for my own local development needs, nor would I really want to perform local / side project work on that machine, or even have the right to do so. I’ve had a chunk of time away from doing personal development and side projects, and I want to kick start that again therefore this prompted me to seek some advise. 

I’m an avid PC gamer and have quite a hefty Windows based rig that I have had some success using WSL for a local development environment, however since upgrading to Windows 11, I’ve really struggled to get it to work. It’s become almost unusable due to my IDE (IntelliJ) crashing when trying to select JDK’s in WSL, and I’ve been thinking about recently whether to buy another dedicated machine, or for instance dual boot my Windows machine? (Haven’t done this for a looong time)

I’ve been eyeing up potentially shelling out for a Mac Mini as a home development machine, as a cheap (ish) way to get into the mac eco system, maybe open up looking at iOS specific application development. Plus then its decoupled from my Windows machine. However my Windows machine is a very powerful machine, with good cooling and performance over all.  I’d be more than happy even with an Ubuntu based build.

For those in the community, what local dev setups do you have? Is the Mac Mini a viable option? Should I completely purge and reinstall WSL and continue with that route? Or should I just dual boot my machine?",SoftwareEngineering,2007,358

In our new product, we are adding support for leaving comments via formatted rich text editors in our product. We have implemented the frontend side (using React + TipTap/Prose-mirror) and are continuing to build out the persistance layer.

I'm on a crossroad and trying to decide what is the best way to persist the data. 

Our options are:

1. Save the generated HTML.
2. Save the content data in JSON format.
3. Save in a custom format provided by our tool of choice.

All three options have benefits and downsides. For example, HTML is very direct because it will be the data that we will display back to the users, but it lacks easy to parse information like user mentions, and it is hard to adjust the style later down the road. JSON contains all the data in a nice and parsable format, but we will need extra effort to convert back and forth between representations.

"*This is part request for advice, but also part venting. Feel free to ignore if I lean too much on the latter.

What strategies can I use to deal with work that does not engage me or even de-motivates me?

My team changed its tech stack completely about a year ago. We went from writing in a functional paradigm, which took me years to get comfortable with (though now I LOVE it) to focusing on OOP and integrating off-the-shelf solutions in an OOP language.

Development work no longer engages me. Everything I write I’m just frustrated that I don’t have the syntax features or safety I had when writing in our previous language. But my boss says it’s supposed to be good for my career growth because our new tech stack is an industry standard so I’ll be more experienced in what companies are looking for. But I am just no longer happy or feeling engaged.

The last few months there’s been a huge push to write unit tests for every component and every layer. Every time I get one of these unit test tickets it takes me far longer to complete than the actual development. We have to mock so many components, mock so much data, and the entire time I just want to throw my laptop at a wall. 

It’s not that the testing is too difficult, I just don’t find it engaging. We have nested data structures and the syntax of this language is more verbose than my previous languages (scripting + functional) and I feel like I’m much slower at getting anything done even though I can work out what needs to be done in my head fairly quickly.

Honestly I feel like I’m acting like a spoiled child. I don’t see other developers throwing a fit. They are not fans of the change but they’re getting their work done all the same. Meanwhile I’m falling behind and my performance is starting to get affected. Every time I get assigned a testing ticket it takes even longer than it took me to develop the feature.

I realize no matter what team I move to, testing is always a part of development. But at least with our old tech stack testing felt like it’s own unique challenge, and I could write the tests as quickly as I could think them up.

I can’t tell if my problem is that I’m in the wrong place - like I just need to move to a team with a language/stack I enjoy - or if it’s that I have a bad mindset. Every job has its good parts and its bad parts. And I feel like I’m pretty bad at dealing with the bad parts. I feel like objectively if I get my work done like everyone else on the team my career is sure to grow. But I am just hating doing my job.

I was faced with a similar issue in my previous job. I wrote a lot in a scripting language and got great at it, but then we had to switch to a DSL for most of our workflow. That DSL felt like it was handicapping me and stunting my growth, and after a year I got fed up and left for a new job.

I’ve only had two jobs but given the similar experience in both, I’m worried that this cycle will repeat itself. I’m wondering if I just need to change my mindset rather than continuing to leave for new positions.

I’m also wondering if maybe I’m just not a good fit for the industry. I absolutely loved college and the intellectual challenge that came with learning new things constantly. I’m wondering if academia would let me pursue these challenges non-stop and whether I should consider doing a graduate program.

Would appreciate any advice. Even telling me I’m acting like kid and need to grow up would be helpful, because then I know it’s just a common experience and I’m not uniquely bad for software work, just need to overcome personal hurdles.",SoftwareEngineering,3589,678

"So before this team was formed, I was already working on the project with people from US for like last 7 months or something. Then the project manager tells me he only has slot for the project for me once he got contract with customer. So basically I was put into a team with all people in India since December. They needed me because basically the project was finished and I knew the project inside out since I did majority of it.

Anyway, originally he says it would be about 3 months and I have meetings with the 8:30pm everyday but since there’s daylight savings I have meetings 9:30pm everyday. I was ok with this at first but I found that I was not getting the same treatment. For example, their engineers get to share their screen, and openly discuss but when it’s my turn they never ask me to screenshare and the manager said yesterday the case is different for me, I need to send everything over email. I get that it’s faster for them to receive updates over email but I never have anyone to go to for help or discuss things technically. I’m starting to see that I do most of the hard work that none of them knows how to do and I have to teach them everything when they’re senior developers and I am a JUNIOR. Also he never seems to understand what I am saying and it’s frustrating. Regardless, my time with him should’ve ended but he keeps extending it because their engineers couldn’t not replace me yet.

"I ran into a client that utilizes MFT for their file transfer over shared drives, basically they have different departments within the company each with a separate shared drive. Anytime someone needs access to data in another dept's drive they use an MFT tool to copy the files over from the source dept's drive to the requesting party's drive. Typically for reports an automated items that process is batched at night.

Is there any security benefit to this type of architecture? Does it help with compliance?",SoftwareEngineering,510,86
"I've seen many, many schedules over the years, but almost no hard numbers about how the reality matched up to the plan. I suspect there are two main reasons for this:

1. Management is embarrassed,
2. The requirements changed over time, so it's not possible to compare what was planned to what actually got done.

I think #2 is bogus. Requirements *always* change. If you remodel your house, you always end up doing more or less than the contractor's estimate. That's not an aberration; that's normal.

Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman writes about this in a chapter of *Thinking Fast and Slow* (""The Planning Delusion""). It's not unique to software. Everyone wants to think their project is unique and there is nothing to be learned from history.

So I'm wondering how much actual data we have on software project lateness: not ""what should have happened"" but ""what *did* happen""?",SoftwareEngineering,879,148

"We often talk about inheritance being overused. Often, we give out ""composition"" as the medicine to cure us from this inheritance-overuse disease. Over time, I've realized that composition, by itself, only helps to replace just one aspect of inheritance. Inheritance is a large subject and there's many reasons people reach for it.

So, I put together [this article](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/composition-alone-cant-replace-inheritance-606760f03d60?source=friends_link&amp;sk=24f58b20b2d4162404376c6f7ec16301) that tries to lay out a bunch of different patterns that can be used in place of inheritance. I've never seen a comprehensive article like this before, and it's the type of article I wish the earlier me had, when I would use inheritance in places where, sure, it worked, but there were definitely better ways to approach the problem that I just wasn't thinking of.

So, my question for the community:
* When do you feel it is appropriate to use inheritance?
* Are there times you've used inheritance in the past, and since then you've also learned of better ways to solve the same problem?
* Are there times you've used inheritance in the past, and you feel that none of the suggestions from the article would have worked well to replace your use of it?
* General feedback on the article is welcome as well, though I'm also cool if you just want to answer these discussion questions after a minimal skim, or without reading it at all (It's a long article).",SoftwareEngineering,1475,233

"I am currently working as a Go developer in the cloud infrastructure department of a large company. My team focuses on developing a managed Kubernetes platform.

I enjoy exploring Kubernetes internals and tackling issues related to distributed systems and scalability.

In addition, I have a background in robotics, having worked for an autonomous vehicles company for three years. I also have \~2 years experience in machine learning, mainly theoretical but with a couple small projects under my belt. I am particularly passionate about everything related to ML/AI, and the recent progress in large language models has obviously piqued my interest even more.

I'm curious if there are any existing or upcoming challenges, or even subfields, at the intersection of these two domains (ML/AI and distributed systems/scalability).

"So, I use Linux for both personal purposes and on the job. I'm a software engineer, mainly working with Java.

The company is currently selling some pre-owned devices (used previously by other engineers), and I can get a Macbook Pro 16 (2019) for 900 Euro

Should I get it? I don't know anything about Macbooks, *Macbook* specs, or how much one costs, but I assume this is a great price, at least from what I could figure from a quick google.

Specs are 16 GB RAM, 512 SSD, Intel i7 9750H.

I have a Linux with fairly good specs too, but the price tag of this Macbook really tempts me..

Should I get it, it's definitely worth 900 Euro, right? Or is it already outdated?

"I recently graduated from university. Now, I am working for a small startup. I like the full-stack aspect of it, as you get in touch with various technologies. Another thing I like is the responsibility you have, and the fact that you see the ""work"" you do. However, I do not share the same philosophy as my co-workers and boss. For them, it is more important to deliver code quickly. The quality (code, architecture, performance, ...) is secondary. Although this works in smaller teams, I feel that it does not allow me to grow as a software engineer. While I get in contact with a lot of different technologies, I only get to have a very surface-level understanding of their concepts (for example ORM, TDD, Docker, ...).

Now, my question: Is this different in big companies? Do you get more time to learn new things in more detail? Eventually, I want to specialize in Software Architecture and DevOps engineering.

"Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process that aims to ensure the quality of the software by running a set of test cases more frequently. This is the opposite of creating the software and then the tests which the software will be tested against.

Usually, the steps you follow on TDD are the following:

1. Add a new test:

* This test should pass **if, and only** **if,** all the specifications defined in the feature are met.
* Focus on the requirements before coding.

2. Run all tests:

* The new test should fail.
* Because it fails, it shows that new code is needed for the new feature.
* This will also validate that the testing mechanism is working correctly and that the new test is not flawed in a way that will always pass.

3. Implement the feature:

* The code you write should be the simplest one that ensures the new test passes.

4. Run all tests:

* All tests should pass.
* If they don't, the code should be revisited, and changes will be made until the tests pass.

5. Refactor as needed:

* Go back and improve the code if needed.
* Rely on the tests to ensure everything works fine after the refactoring.

I wrote about an educational example to show the basics of TDD using Data Structures, you can read about it here: [A Tale of Testing: The Basics of Test-Driven Development with a Focus on Data Structures](https://albexl.hashnode.dev/a-tale-of-testing-the-basics-of-test-driven-development-with-a-focus-on-data-structures)

"Hey everyone!

I wanted to share my atypical journey of transitioning from IT Support to Software Engineering. I don't often come across stories of people taking this path, so I figured it's high time I shared my experience and answer any questions you might have. What makes my story unusual is that I have no degree, no formal training, and no Bootcamp experience.

**2016: Humble Beginnings**

My journey began in 2016 as an IT Support technician at a bank, earning a mere $12.55/hour. Trying to support my family on this salary was a struggle. I knew I had to make a change, so in 2018, I obtained my CDL and ventured into the oil field. This move tripled my income to $36/hour, allowing me to pay bills and save up for a future move to a bigger city with better IT job opportunities.

**2018: The Oil Field Nightmare**

I loathed every second of my time in the oil field. The working conditions were abysmal—115-hour weeks, 18-32 hour shifts with no breaks, 24/7 on-call, and no scheduled days off. Weather was no friend either, with temperatures ranging from -30 to 100 degrees. I wouldn't recommend this experience to my worst enemy.

**2020: A New Beginning**

By 2020, I had saved enough to pay off all my debts, allowing me to quit the oil field, move to the big city, and survive on a lower salary. I landed a temp job at a large corporation, working in Desktop Support for a 3-month contract at $16/hour. While it didn't pay the bills entirely, my debt-free life made the hit to my savings more manageable.

**2020: Apple Support and the School District**

As my contract ended, I received a job offer from a school district as an Apple Support tech, earning $18/hour. This job barely covered the bills, but it was a ton of work. I was the sole technician for the entire district, managing iPads, Macs, and support tickets.

**2021: Stepping up as Desktop Technician**

In 2021, I was offered a position as a Desktop Technician for the county, which paid $24/hour. Initially, the workload was manageable, and I had some extra money to invest. However, two months in, my situation changed as I had to commute to five different offices with only 31 cents/mile in reimbursement.

When the Intune specialist resigned, I inherited their responsibilities, now juggling device management, scripting, packaging, and support tickets for the entire county.

**2022: Turning the Tide with SwiftUI**

By the third quarter of 2022, I was fed up with my stagnant pay and ever-increasing workload. Desperate for a change, I dove into software development, specifically iOS development. I committed to Paul Hudson's 100 Days of SwiftUI, completing the challenge in December 2022. I began a personal project (a habit-tracking app) and started applying for jobs.

**2023: Breakthrough at Last!**

Two months and 180 applications later, I finally landed my first interview. A medical company needed an iOS developer to transition their app from Flutter to native development. I aced both interviews and was offered the position at a whopping $55/hour! The job is a hybrid, requiring me to be in the office only on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

This change has been transformative for me. I've left the mundane world of basic support tickets behind and now play a crucial role in developing software that improves people's lives. My journey from IT Support to Software Engineering may have been unconventional, but it's a testament to the power of perseverance and self-motivation.

**Conclusion: Embracing the Unconventional Path**

My story is a reminder that it's never too late to pivot your career and chase your dreams. While the road to success may not be a straight line, embracing the challenges and staying determined can open doors you never thought possible. I hope my experience inspires others in IT Support roles to explore the exciting world of software engineering and find their own paths to success.

If you have any questions or want to know more about my journey, please feel free to ask. I'm happy to share any insights I've gained along the way.

"Hello, I'm trying to compile a list of reasons why unnecessary side effects are undesirable in the long term.

There are some nice resources out there, for example, [this awesome thread](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/15269/why-are-side-effects-considered-evil-in-functional-programming) or Eric Elliot's post about [simplicity and side effects](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-single-biggest-mistake-programmers-make-every-day-62366b432308). Then there are more specific good posts about Python [import-time side effects](https://chrismorgan.info/blog/say-no-to-import-side-effects-in-python/) and the generic observation that side effects lead to [mocking in tests](https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/you-dont-hate-mocks-you-hate-side-effects). The majority of side-effect-related posts discuss it in the context of functional programming ([this one](https://thejs.dev/jmitchell/what-are-side-effects-and-what-you-can-do-about-them-jws), another [very good one from Jesse Warden](https://jessewarden.com/books/real-world-functional-programming/part1/01_input_output_side_effects.html), [one more](https://www.yld.io/blog/the-not-so-scary-guide-to-functional-programming/)).

But I just wanted to make a short list that you can pull out when needed. So here we go:

Code with side effects

* is fragile - unnecessary side effects lead to unexpected crashes because they deal with the external world.
* is typically slow - code lines with side effects are slower than ""normal"" code.
* is hard to optimize - a compiler or a developer has fewer degrees of freedom when optimizing a function with side effects.
* is hard to use concurrently - side effects mutate state and would clash in a concurrent environment.
* is hard to read and understand - it is hard to follow the logic that influences the external world and mutates the external state.
* is hard to reuse - developers would be reluctant to reuse code that does too many things (as opposed to a single return statement).
* is hard to debug, release and write tests - because of external dependencies, it is hard to write good tests which leads to longer/fragile releases

I'm mainly a Python/C++ developer, but looking online, I'm pretty sure those reasons apply to other non-FP languages like JavaScript or Java. I put more detailed arguments into [a blogpost](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/all-dangers-of-side-effects-for-python-coders-fdf0743457a3) on each of those items, and I'm looking for more. Does anyone have more resources on side effects which could be read by a junior dev without FP background?

P.S. Again, here I'm talking about **unnecessary** side effects: every software must have some side effects to be useful.",SoftwareEngineering,2733,340

"String libraries exist to reduce boilerplate. We don't want to write `for i = 10 to 15; array.add(s[i]); next` when we could write `substring(s, 10, 6)`.

I have written an extensive string library to clear up any clutter related to the processing of strings. A focus of the library is on the elimination of ""magic arithmetic,"" i.e., expressions such as `last - first + 1`, which leave unexplained their exact purpose. My hope is that it will increase comprehension and eliminate off-by-one errors and other products of string-madness. The library is rather large, and leads me to wonder what has already been done in the field.

Crucial to the library is what we should name the functions. Christopher J. Date warned us to observe the ""Great Logical Differences."" We want to know exactly when an index function is zero-based or one-based, when a range function includes or excludes the upper-bound, and when a search function returns 0 or -1 when it fails. Not doing so may risk catastrophe.

Accordingly, it may be argued that string functions should be given precise names to distinguish their use. One of my functions is named `OneBasedLineNumberAt`. I included the modifier `OneBased` so anyone would know what output to expect. Another issue is parameter order. Requiring a name to indicate parameter order reduces the chance of reversing the arguments by mistake. Instead of `Join`, then, one may write `JoinArrayWithDelimiter`. The order of the parameters is determined by their order in the name. Thus, we may expect the function to first accept the array and then the delimiter.

Here are the string functions I've created so far. The names are not perfect. The preponderance of 'Move' and 'Seek' functions is to prevent off-by-one errors. Note that some of these can be generalized to arbitrary collections of items other than characters in a string:

    PadLeft                              MoveBackwardUntilFirstOfPredicate
    IsWhiteSpace                         MoveBackwardUntilAfterPredicate

"It said ""As an AI language model, I have the knowledge to explain the concepts and steps involved in developing a software program that can share hardware resources over a network. However, creating a virtualization software solution that is efficient and reliable requires advanced programming knowledge and experience.

To create a program that shares hardware resources over a network, the software would need to be able to detect and allocate resources on the host computer, such as the GPU, CPU, and RAM, and allow remote access to these resources over a network. The program would also need to handle input/output between the host and remote client devices, and optimize performance to minimize latency and input lag.

Programming such a software requires knowledge of operating systems, networking, and virtualization technologies, as well as low-level programming languages like C/C++. It would also require extensive testing and optimization to ensure that the program is stable and performs well.

"I've been with a company in a junior position for 6 months now. It's a start up that consists of 2 developers, one being my lead, and the other myself. There is another person who can do some scripting, but mainly does client relations. Altogether there are 5 people in the company.    


My job from the start was to basically take tasks as they were assigned to me. Some would be bugs, others would be frontend implementations of a given service (think a library system). It would consist of me generating stuff for the other developer to have an easier time doing the backend, then I would use their backend functions to make my frontend work.   


Anyway, I found that no matter the task I was given, I would need help. Primarily regarding the code. One thing is reading the code, but there are so many nuances with the business that although I can read it, I don't understand why certain things are necessary. Nothing is commented, also. So typically, my lead would need to explain the system to me (we lack documentation there too) and I'd go off an implement what I could based on that. If I was given a bug, the same process happened. I could sometimes track it down, but then have no understanding of the big picture of what the code was trying to achieve, that I couldn't actually fix it.  


I should mention that this is work from home and 90% of my day I am by myself, the other 10% I am talking to my lead in discord.  


The problem I have is there's so much information to retain, and I'm never giving a full picture as my lead ""doesn't want to overwhelm me"" - which is fair. But, I struggle to remember things if I don't have dots to connect them to. My lead will get frustrated when I don't remember things - I write things down, but I don't remember the relationship between data tables we used 2 months ago and need a refresher.  


On top of that. The lead has a very particular way they like things to be done, but they refuse to micro manage. Typically, this results in me putting up a PR and they just go in and change it anyway. Sometimes to the point where all my code is changed and it was just a waste of time for me to do it. Note, that they tell me to keep things as simple as possible and not to make coding decisions based on anticipation of possibilities in the future.  


Other problems are poor management. Nobody knows who's doing what tasks. I've tried implementing labels and project tables in github, but no one seems to take to them. So, what ends up happening is I start on a task ""assigned to me"" or usually not (but it is easy), that the lead is already doing. Sometimes I'll start on a task and have assigned myself to it, and the lead does it.  


Now, the lead is away for months. They'll be doing around 10 hours a week. But will be away completely for the next month. They've left a bit unfinished, so I can't use certain areas of the codebase. I have no one other than the boss assigning me tasks, but he doesn't know my capabilities. I have no one to ask code related questions and the business is very hands off, so I mainly have to find my own work.

"# Background

I am on a team that develops many internal tools (Line of Business apps) to support business operations. We have around 50 independent web applications with varying levels of complexity, business logic, and integrations with both internal and external APIs. Not all applications use the exact same technology. The reason there are so many apps is because of the different business domains and the purposes that they serve.

# The Problem

Due to so many different sites, users have to ""know"" where to go to in order to ""find their thing"". Since it is web based, you can bookmark all the stuff you want. But this makes it difficult for new users  to learn where to go to find X business function. In addition, we must maintain each app with its framework and packages, so upgrading them all is tedious.

We are looking to add ""more"", but hesitant to spin up more web apps to fit different business needs.

It would be great from a user experience if everything could be access from the same UI and URL paths, for instance: ""[operations.company.com/finance](https://operations.company.com/finance)"" and ""[operations.company.com/shipping](https://operations.company.com/shipping)"" favored over ""[finance.company.com](https://finance.company.com)"" and ""[shipping.company.com](https://shipping.company.com)"".

# How to Implement?

The look and feel between different ""modules"" should generally be the same. However, I am unsure how to actually implement this in practice because we have several large code bases with their own UI's and API's.

Actually implementing something like this is where I get tripped up:

1. How do you prevent all code from being in one repository?
2. Does all UI code have to live inside the UI project, and then do you integrate with all backend APIs?
3. How to scale as more functionality is added?
4. Are there other strategies for accomplishing a **unified user experience**?

I've seen ""Micro front ends"" thrown around as a buzzword, but I'm seeing mostly negative experiences regarding that. Perhaps it is something to try, but I don't fully understand it and if it is worth the investment.

*&lt;side thought&gt;* I always have wondered how large web apps manage their deployments and code (example: Azure DevOps and all its modules). Is it just one big UI and monolith repo and one pipeline deployment to rule them all? If not, how is this actually accomplished? *&lt;/end side thought&gt;*

"I’ll give an actual scenario we can kick around implementation ideas with. My org needs a more powerful version of Active Directory (AD). I’ll call it “AD2” for short. Many apps need employee info and their position in the organization, including who their supervisor is. There are too many needs and requests for AD to deal with. (Maybe AD can be tweaked for more features &amp; power, but let’s put that aside for now.)

So one plan is to use our primary database brand, MS-SQL-Server (“MS-SQL” for short), to make a database with all the needed employee and org info: “AD2”. A selected group of people would be in charge of maintaining the content. (At this point it does not need a dedicated programmer(s) after initial release, just as-needed maintenance.)

Since MS-SQL is already used by most our apps, it’s easier to just query that info from it. We don’t initially need a JSON web interface. In the future some app or service may eventually need a web interface; and there are plugins for MS-SQL that allow Stored Procedure/View calls to accept and emit JSON services with little or no programming. If that’s not good enough, then we could make a mini-intranet-app to emit and receive JSON for the sub-set needed by these special apps.

So we have 3 levels of K.I.S.S. here for AD2:

1. Use the shop RDBMS to share needed info/queries.
2. Use plugins that convert already-written Stored Procedure/View I/O to web services.
3. Write a web-app wrapper around the Stored Procedures/Views, probably only for specific needs rather than wrap them all.

In our org, a medium-sized org, it would be foolish to start with #3 first. We can later get JSON-over-http if necessary, without starting from scratch. 

Further, if AD2 needs info from other databases, it’s relatively easy to make cross-database links/connections on the DB server(s) itself without coding a communication service, since it’s the same DB brand. Making a DB-vendor-neutral wrapper (JSON calls) is overkill as the default.

Some microservice proponents say #1 is already “microservices” but many don’t because it’s not “vendor neutral”.

If an org didn’t have a standard RDBMS (DB potpourri), then maybe JSON-first would be more rational. But I recommend that small and medium orgs settle on a primary RBDMS brand because it makes many things simpler, not just service sharing. 

For really big orgs, that may not be feasible; I don’t have enough experience in enough big orgs to comment. But I’ve worked in many small and medium orgs as both an employee and contractor, and this includes public and private. DB-first for inter-app info sharing is by far usually better.",SoftwareEngineering,2642,441
"Three years ago, I took a Data Structure (CS61B) class at UC Berkeley and struggled a lot. Back then I felt that I was mentally slow to process all these materials and couldn't find a good way to digest all these stuff. My estimation of big O was always wrong. My code was always running the slowest in class. Choosing what data structure or algorithm under what situation was always a myth. Coding in Java and debugging were painful as hell. I was defeated and questioned whether I had the proper IQ at all for this industry. Should I just give up and work as a data analyst?

" I'm  trying to understand how to solve the problem of pattern matching in a  stream of objects that represent events. Each object has keys and  values. For example {name: ""John Doe"", ""location"": ""latt: 40, long: 50"",  ...}. The pattern I want to match is for example an object with  name=""John Doe"" followed within 5 seconds by an object with name=""Jane  Doe"".

This can be solved using  finite automata. There needs to be a transition to the reset state, and a  transition to matching Joe Done, and a transition to match also Jane  Doe.

When programming this in  Java, one approach is to use int state, then add some if/else conditions  to change the state depending on whether the input event has the  expected name, and so on.

I  don't want to use a 3rd party software which compiles some made up  language into automata. I want to design and implement automata myself  to have a full control over what it is doing, and to make it easier to  debug and test.

1. Is there any particular tool which I can use to design finite automata efficiently and to generate  a java code?
2. Can  you advise on a method to specify requirements, design, construct, and  test an automata-based application for pattern matching in a stream of  objects?
3. Is  there any background theory which you would recommend that is specific  for coding custom pattern matching apps using automata in Java without  using frameworks?",SoftwareEngineering,1410,243

"Curious about software engineers relationship with weed and job. I’ve heard smoke use while working, how does this effect u personally?",SoftwareEngineering,135,21
"In software engineering, it seems to be standard practice to just give a task to a new employee and say “you figure it out.” There’s no training, no help, no collaboration. The new employee has to work independently and teach himself. And use google. Why? 

For example, I’ve been at my current job for about 2.5 months, and I’m being asked to make a significant change to the Spending Summary App. I’m not familiar with the Spending Summary App. Other developers wrote the app before I joined the company, probably over the course of many years. It’s over 5000 lines of code. It uses external libraries. It uses Maven, Lombok, Spring Boot, AOP, and probably some other frameworks that I’m not aware of.

I’m also being asked to use Grafana to make a panel that displays an app’s error rate, success rate, pool, and other data. I’ve never used Grafana before. From what I’ve gathered, Grafana uses Lucene, Gaia, and Elasticsearch. I’m not familiar with these things. No one is helping me. 

Wouldn’t it make sense to pair me up with a more experienced engineer, and for us to work together on this task, and for me to learn from them?

To explain how I feel, here are some analogies:

1. A student enrolls in Calculus 1. On the first day of class, the teacher hands him a final exam from Calculus 3, and says “figure it out” and then walks away.

2. You want to learn how to play the saxophone, and you’ve never played before. You get in touch with a musician who’s been playing the saxophone for 10 years. The musician hands you a saxophone and says “start playing” and then walks away.

3. You’ve never flown a helicopter before. You meet an experienced helicopter pilot. He shows you a helicopter, puts you in the pilot’s seat, and says, “please fly the helicopter,” and then he walks away. Then, he comes back to you, one week later, and yells at you and says “why haven’t you flown the helicopter yet?!”

I think we can all agree that these three examples are ridiculous. This would not result in a good knowledge of calculus, or a good saxophone player, or a good helicopter pilot.

So, why is this so common in software engineering? I’ve had two software engineering jobs within the past three years, at two different companies, and I was treated like this at both jobs. It seems to be a standard practice in the software industry. Why?

One explanation I’ve heard is, “the other programmers are busy with their own tasks, so they don’t have time to work with you and train you.” To continue the analogy, imagine you’ve never flown a helicopter before, and your boss says, “The other pilot has to fly to Baltimore, so he’s not going to train you. So please teach yourself how to fly a helicopter and fly yourself to Philadelphia.” Isn’t there something wrong with that? Wouldn’t it be better to make the training a priority? Allow the new pilot and the experienced pilot to fly together to Baltimore, and allow the new guy to watch and learn, and don’t try to send the new guy to Philly alone. Also, deliver a message to the customer, and say “I’m sorry, but we can’t send a helicopter to Philadelphia this week.”",SoftwareEngineering,3120,560

Hello everyone, I recently got placed as a fresher in a company. Initially I submitted a cv/resume in which I had mentioned an unpaid internship.

" I am 29 and at the start of my journey to learn the basics of programming. Why? I want to build and operate a software development agency out of South Asia.

I am under no delusions; I am searching for and will hire a top-tier Co-founder/CTO/Head of Engineering. I will lead the business side of things.

I have already been talking to people in the US and most mention the following problems they face when outsourcing/off-shoring etc:

* Communication: strong accents, difficulty understanding idioms and colloquialisms
* Time difference: limited overlapping work hours, potential delays
* Cultural differences: limited understanding of product and customer needs
* Priorities: uncertainty about project ranking, the potential for the sudden departure
* Rare success stories: requires deep cultural understanding and hands-on management
* 'Senior devs' who are junior or fresh. Talent agencies bullshit them.

Solutions I have in mind:

1. Only hire developers with strong technical English along with successful test scores in IELTS/TOEFL etc.
2. Follow a schedule that offers a 4-hour overlap with Eastern and Central US.
3. Hire those with at least 3 years of experience. In those 3 years, they should have worked on clients/products from US/Canada/Australia, and Western Europe only.
4. Only offer full-time/dedicated staff that the client can manage as they see fit and will integrate into their communication/reporting/working tool stack.
5. We will offer no single developer but teams of software developers. The smallest team offering will comprise 3 mid-tier devs working under 1 senior dev (team of 4)
6. The client gets to interview, screen, and test them for the first 2 weeks at zero cost.

Now, with all the above information in mind, I have 3 questions:

1. What level of conceptual understanding of programming do I need to have to communicate with my CTO/Co-Founder effectively?
2. What do you think of my solutions? What would you add?
3. What other issues did you face with outsourcing and off-shore teams?",SoftwareEngineering,2028,325

"Hello! I want to collect some opinions on a topic we discussed with friends. Imagine you are reviewing a Pull Request and are pretty happy about it. But then you notice something that:

* introduces technical debt for no reason
* takes 60 seconds to fix

but at the same time

* the fix wouldn't change anything today
* it's unrelated to the main topic of a PR

Would you block it? Would you leave a comment but let it pass?

Mainly, we spoke about unnecessary side effects in the code. Here are some stripped-down but real examples:

    def compute_results(results: List[int]) -&gt; None:
        results.clear()
        for i in range(N):
            results.append(compute(i))

could be replaced by a pure function that doesn't mutate input arguments

    def compute_results() -&gt; List[int]:
        results = []
        for i in range(N):
            results.append(compute(i))
        return results

or imagine an unnecessary global variable:

    double LEARNING_RATE;
    
    double compute(x) {
        int g = ... some algorithm with x...
        return LEARNING_RATE*g;
    }
    
    int main() {
        LEARNING_RATE = 0.1;
        .. use compute(2);
        return 0;
    }

that could be removed completely

    double compute(x, learningRate) {
        int g = ... some algorithm with x...
        return learningRate*g;
    }
    
    int main() {
        double learningRate = 0.1;
        .. use compute(2, learningRate);
        return 0;
    }

The argument in both cases is that it's cleaner to avoid side effects. The functions were created in the PR, but at the same time it's not really the topic of the PR.

To create your own requirements engineering process, use the representative process below and add stuff from page 44. Alternatively, remove some stuff from the representative process below or replace it.

&amp;#x200B;

A representative requirements engineering process (page 46 of the book + comments based on the book):

1. **Define business requirements** (fill the Vision and Scope template - page 81 tells you how to fill it. A business requirement is for example to increase market share in region X by Y % within Z months)
2. **Identify user classes** and their characteristics (various groups of users for your product that might differ in their use, frequency, features, etc. Page 105 details the process)
3. **Identify user representatives** (identify an individual who can serve as a representative for each group of users)
4. **Identify requirements decision-makers** (people who will resolve conflicting requirements, evaluate change requests, etc. Page 108 or for Agile page 115)
5. **Plan elicitation** (plan how you will do requirements elicitation and management, page 129. This includes planning an approach, i.e. interviews, workshops, focus groups, observations, questionnaires, system interface analysis, user interface analysis, document analysis - pages 121-128)
6. **Work with user representatives to identify user requirements** (explore the tasks user representatives are trying to accomplish with software and express user requirements as use cases, user stories, or scenarios - page 144. A user requirement is for example to print a mailing label for a parcel)
7. **Prioritize user requirements** (the team must implement the highest value or most timely functionality first.  So, an analytical approach must determine the implementation priority of product features, use cases, user stories, or functional requirements. Based on this, you can determine what release or increment will contain the requirement. - page 313 has more details)
8. **Flesh out user requirements** (do another round of elicitation, for example another interview stakeholders, and this time add more detail and specificity to user requirements. The first round only identified high-level requirements without any detail. The first round was for example to print a mailing label for a parcel. This round is where you ask about the required fields that should be included in the mailing label, whether there are any selectable lists, etc. and you collect all the details)
9. **Derive functional requirements from user requirements** (what the system needs to do to support the user requirement. One possible approach is to use case scenarios depicting the interaction between a primary actor and the system. So, in this case the steps that the system must do can be derived from the scenario and added as functional requirements, grouped by a feature name. One product feature can have many requirements)
10. **Model the requirements** (an analysis model is a diagram that depicts requirements visually.  Models can reveal incorrect, inconsistent, missing, and superfluous requirements. Models include data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, state-transition diagrams, state tables, dialog maps, decision trees, and other. (pages 93-95, 103, 106, 109, 112))
11. **Specify non-functional requirements** (go beyond the functional descriptions to understand what is required to achieve success. Sometimes, merely performing a function is not enough because the function does not satisfy the required qualities. For example, performance, availability, reliability, usability, modifiability and other)
12. **Review requirements** (assemble a small team of reviewers for a peer review to represent different perspectives, such as analyst, customer, developer, and testers. Have them carefully examine the written requirements, analysis models, and related information for defects. page 329 has more details)
13. **Create user interface and technical prototypes** (when uncertain about the requirements, construct a prototype. A partial, possible, or preliminary implementation, to make the concepts and possibilities more tangible. This achieves a mutual understanding of the problem being solved between developers and users. It also helps to validate requirements. Page 295 has more information on how to create a prototypes.)
14. **Develop or evolve architecture** (it is possible to decide on the overall type of the system based on having requirements. One approach is a decomposition of the overall system into subsystems. And further, each subsystem can have some components.)
15. **Allocate requirements to subsystems or components** (requirements for a complex product that contains multiple subsystems must be allocated between software, hardware, and human subsystems and components. Page 439 has more information)
16. **Develop tests from requirements** (tests are an alternative view of the requirements. Writing tests requires you to think how to verify the required functionality, or a non-functional requirement was correctly implemented. Map tests to functional and non-functional requirements to make sure no requirement was overlooked. Agile projects often create acceptance tests in lieu of  detailed functional requirements. That means whether the solution is fit for use and meets user needs.)
17. **Validate user requirements, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, analysis models, and prototypes** (Sign-off by stakeholders. Modeling checking for correctness, completeness, consistency. Another approach is to simulate the system using a commercial tool, i.e. executable mock-ups.)

Finally, you will repeat the whole process for all subsequent iterations (assuming you're using an iterative SDLC. Agile is always iterative.)

&amp;#x200B;

To improve your requirements engineering process, once you have one, use page 517.

Note that the above process doesn't include everything available, and isn't tailored to your specific project. Use page 44 to see what else you could put in there to tailor it. This is an iterative process and can be used with Agile projects.",SoftwareEngineering,6881,909

"Along with other ubiquitous industry terms like ""Architecture"" and ""Infrastructure"" I feel that ""Technical Debt"" has now been overused and is now too vague to be useful. I will provide some examples but in general I would like to her everyone's unbiased opinion.

I think the typical definition of 'technical debt' is akin to: 

&gt;Someone took a shortcut to get something to ship, and now we have to write code to fix the shortcut and ""do it the right way.""

I'm actually fine with that definition. Here are some examples where usage of the term 'technical debt' gets fuzzy:

* No shortcuts at all but a carefully built, extensible, well running application was built on a library or runtime that has a new version out. Is that technical debt?
* A key library is expectantly sunset. 
* A SaaS product can handle a central component of our architecture and we can now 'buy' instead of 'build' and we get 10x more features. Does our current solution now contain technical debt?
* Roadmap items that require a lot of upfront tooling before we can even touch them. 
* Bugs that have workarounds.
* DevOps pipelines that remain painfully slow because of understaffing.

"Hey, for those of you in fintech. Let’s say you’re building an application which has various wallets. Let’s say, you have a CAD wallet and a USD wallet. Now your system allows you to trade some USD to some provider at some rate, then the provider gives you some CAD. I have a little problem currently and i wanted to gain some insight on how it’s actually done. 

I have read about storing currencies in their lowest denomination on the application and db level to prevent floating points and what not. That makes sense to me. But what doesn’t make sense to me is handling the rates from the exchange. Let’s say a rate is 1.2 to convert from USD to CAD, does the rate have to be converted to the lowest denominator as well? Because multiplying a rate(float) by some other currency will cause errors. 

If i’m multiplying the rate and the monetary values by 100 (assuming all currencies base value is 100), do I have to divide the stored monetary values by 100x100 when displaying to the frontend?

I’m 16 and in the future I want to start an engineering company. I have been doing a lot of research and most sources say I should pursue an EngD degree.

"I’m not sure if I want to switch my discipline?

I’m currently in the middle of my second semester so far and I have been questioning my engineering discipline from mechanical to software. I like mechanical engineering because of how broad the field could be and I could help design new things. On the other hand I see software engineering as something of the future with the rise of technology and correct me if I’m wrong I feel like it would be more secured. Will software engineering be a whole new field, yes, but I enjoy learning new things.

"I have a component that subscribes to everything. It has a polled loop that looks for all topics and subscribes to them (and checks that previously subscribed to topics still have publishers). The subscription callback serializes to JSON, stores the serialized value in a hashmap, and then calls a user provided callback with the new data (either the message, or meta data such as change in liveliness) so the user of this component can choose to either keep things event driven, or poll the hashmap.

This component is a sub component of two systems: A Qt GUI to convert messages into QJsValues so they can be accessed by my QML views, and in a gateway application to log all data changes to an EPICS system.

What should I call this component?

The best name I can think of is DMSS (Discover, Monitor Health, Subscribe to all, Serialize).

"If we assume the current hype cycle is correct, that in the near future all code will be written by large language models (LLM) given some minimal input by the few remaining developers.

I think you can argue that the amazing innovation in software is from developers strugging to write something, and then coming up with new mental models and abstractions that they then implement as something new that lets them do the old thing easier or do a thing that was never possible before. This applies to anything as simple as C# await/async for handling asynchronous situations (something that you could always do in .NET but this really made much more comprehensible) to entirely new languages and frameworks.

Without the above dynamic, why would you be driven or even think of inventing something new? Even if you did, how would the LLM coding assistants take advantage of it without having large piles of examples to train on?",SoftwareEngineering,926,158

"Hello everyone! I'm looking for some guidance on my current situation.

 I've lived a VERY unorthodox life thus far. I'm currently 25 years old, at the age of 16 I started a business and dropped out of high school. I've now sold that business and I'm ready to move on to the next chapter of my life. Out of necessity, I learned Python, JS, and HTML/CSS. From a young age, I've always been into computers and technology in general. Software development is something I find fascinating and would like to pursue. I would love to return to school to get a CS or SE degree but this seems unlikely due to my past and almost zero math skills. I believe my only option is the self-taught route, but just because I can learn how to write some code doesn't make me a programmer, I feel like I'll be missing the deeper fundamentals of it all.

 My question is... Realistically, is there a route I can take to get into college? If not, is going the self-taught route a waste of time?

Additionally: A lot of people around me suggest I start another business. Statistically speaking I was incredibly lucky to be successful. 95% of businesses fail within the first 10 years.

"Need some help guiding me to correct path. Goal is to process multiple video streams at the same time. Also need to store the streams for training models.

Current system is pretty much all proprietary and sort of working but it is not very fault tolerant. We keep having some random issues with it and not sure how to improve things. I think we should change the architecture to make it more resilient.

What we have now is a script that acts as a sort of scheduler. It receives commands over websocket to start and stop capturing streams, captures them, stores a copy on a disk and also pipes it to ffmpeg. Ffmpeg then takes the stream from stdin and dumps frames to stdout that get piped to script that runs the model on said frames.

The issues we keep having:

* If there is a network issue and stream breaks then the whole pipeline needs to be restarted, ffmpeg doesn't seem to be able to handle it. Restarting pipeline is slow and model loses it's state.
* It all runs in Python and if some part of the code gets blocked or runs slow or all GPUs are busy, the whole pipeline can grind to an halt. Debugging this is a nightmare because any part of the pipeline can be the cause. Also the files stored on disk seem to be affected (shorter than they should be).

What I'd like to have: 

* System where this pipeline is cut up into smaller independent parts
* Model should never be restarted because of network issues
* Fault in one part of pipeline shouldn't affect others

"Software Engineering is defined by the IEEE as the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software. And the study of these approaches.

It has a standardized guide to the software engineering body of knowledge (SWEBOK).

Practitioners have a problem of not having any engineering approaches (meaning processes).

Where can we get templates, standards, guides for both Agile and Plan-Based requirements engineering, software design, software construction, and software testing?

"Traditionally, I'm used to separation of the interface and a class implementation. Basically for every class there would be a test implementation on the same interface. Even when a class did not have any other implementation other than the test implementation the interface was mandatory.

Lately I've been moving away from this as I feel like the extra layer does not neccesarily add anything. 

\- When I'm writing small single responsibility classes, there will only be one public method anyway.

\- Test implementations are no longer neccesary with the current mocking frameworks

\- Because of the above, the function of an interface would be there to vary the implementation at run time. But making an interface upfront seems to fall in YAWGNI territory - the interface should be made when you actually create a new implementation.

Now in my current job I also need to review and analyse quite a lot of code, and I'm using static analysis tools for this.

"**TL;DR**

Incompetent managers destroy careers/dreams/lifes of new young developers, and budget of companies.

**Full story**

This post is not about me. I'm almost 20 years in software development, I was lucky to work mostly with good engineers, managers and peers. I grew a lot with them, and I have good manager right now.

Since 3 years I'm doing technical interviews to the company I work for. Our process checks coding skills (any language to be chosen by candidate), system design and overall technology knowledge.

Questions are simple (coding task is little harder than famous FizzBuzz), design a system where there are 3 API endpoint, 2 events, 1 or 2 queues, 1 database. These are questions thst competent medium/senior solves in 10-20 minutes max!

Recently I've interviewed few Engineering Managers, who claimed in their CVs that they have circa 10-15 years of experience. They can't properly write 2 or 3 classes with 3 properties each, and 2-3 public methods. They write one big nested `if/elseif/elseif/else code`. In system design they can't explain what arrows means on theirs diagram, or where are boundaries of each domain or service, everything tightly coupled.

When we talk about theory they claim they know e.g. DDD, but they have no idea about what ""domain"" is, what ""entity"" is, or what ""domain event"" is.

When we talk about processes, some of them claim that they don't do tests because it slows down the development (and they handle platforms that makes millions of $$$).

Of course there are good ones, but maybe 1 or 2 per each 10.

If anyone of you got under such Engineering Manager in first few years of your career you would be doomed. Imagine such people being your bosses? Freaking DISASTER.

Please don't think I'm bragging here or being arogant. No - I'm just fairly average dev. I'm not a rockstar, I barely passed FAANG interview once in my career (but I rejected it for personal reasons). 

But The level of these Impostors? Ridiculous!

I know I'll get few downvotes now, I know some will tell me that Engineering Managers shouldn't be experts. Of course, but they should have basic knowledge. For God's sake.

How the hell such weak EMs can help others grow if they can't do basic engineering? 

Seriously - if you're one of such EM, please change career, and leave this industry!

Now since I'm in this new company I've been working on a website including backend for a customer. Everything nice and good. I'm mainly frontend dev so I focus on this. There I build everything from scratch what really made fun.

But when I have to work in the backend my boss always comes to me and tell me that they do this in a different way and that he want's to change it so that it looks like everyone else. I think that is really strange, because I haven't got any instructions on how to do something.

My boss always want's to copy some code from all over the whole DevOps Server and ""reuse"" it. But whenever I made a suggestion to change this (especially in the backend) because it's better, I get rejected because it should look like everyone else.

"We have a single Java component which reads messages from multiple sources, REST, kafka, files and ingest them and saves them into cassandra. The component also hands over the messages to processing component so that processing component does not have to hit cassandra (helping us reduce cloud cost involved in db reads). Cassandra and message processing component are running in cloud. but the Java component does not. We are planning to refactor the Java component before moving it to cloud. We have thought of following:

* We want to break the component into multiple stand alone consumer components, each of which will consume from single source.
* We might need multiple instances of each of these components running. For example, we can have multiple kafka consumers that can read from kafka efficiently. 
* Currently, if a Java component is reading from specific source, it updates this information in db and any other instance of component first checks this information in db to check if there is any unconsumed source and then starts consuming from that source. So db information kind of provide locking mechanism to avoid parallel reads from the same source.  **Q1.** Is this correct way to implement this functionality? What is industry standard approach (any well know library / approach)?
* Kafka consumer cluster can orchestrate consuming messages. So we wont need any such locking mechanism for kafka consumers. **Q2.** But how should we implement locking mechanism for REST and file consumers. 
* **Q3.** Will it be overkill to replicate kafka's architecture for consuming from these other sources? That is, does it make sense / sounds feasible to implement consumer cluster which read from REST (or files) and have kafka like features (master-slave redundancy, master election etc)? **Q4.** Are there already such libraries? If yes, can someone point in right direction (may be a link to high level API / library that Kafka implements in order to achieve those features, so that we can also implement it to quickly inherit those features. Or Kafka simply implements these features from scratch?)
* **Q5.** Is simply containerising these small consumer components and running them on kubernetes cluster enough (with locking still done through db)?

"Hi guys! I’m currently enrolled in fullstack academy.

I’ve done more self teaching than learning from them. I’ve learned so much on my own that I’d rather teach myself. I’ve been building and working on my own projects. 


I also have heard a certification alone means nothing without shown skill. I have a couple of friends who did a bootcamp, and did nothing after to refine their skill. So they’re back at their old jobs.


I’ve been studying now since September, and I’m two months into bootcamp. 


But it just doesn’t seem worth the stress right now of needing to learn in fast paced, and poorly taught environments.

Is it better just to reach myself the skills and try for a job in a year or so when the market is back up?",SoftwareEngineering,731,133
"This is my first job as a software developer and only 2 of the managing people in my team usually gives me tasks. When I first joined this team, although I had &lt;1 year of experience and everyone had 10+ years of experience, I knew way more on the current project than everyone else since I had been studying and working on the materials for the last couple of months. So I ended up teaching everyone the tools and everything about the project. Long story short, I had already wrote the entire project with my previous team while this project was still unofficial so when I am placed on this project with different people, we are using the code I wrote previously and now we are fixing stuff up to deliver to the customer.

These past days, a developer on my team is question my logic, so I explain to him why I wrote it that way. Then he makes a critique about and he suggest a different idea, and he tells ME to try it. It makes me annoyed because of the fact that he's telling me to try it when he can try it himself. Is he even allowed to tell me what to do when he's not the manager? I know as a young developer, I should listen to his advice but it's just I am so certain I know more on the project than he does but he keeps explaining things to me and CCing one of the managers and it sounds like he's trying to sound so knowledgable and trying command me what to do.

Sorry, but he had to learn these things from me and then he has critiques with my code, and then tells me to try his ideas. I don't have a problem if he wants to fix the code but why doesn't he do it himself?

"Hey,

I work in a 500 people company and the engineering department is really weak compared to other companies I've worked at over my career.

* We have zero automated testing as devs refuse to write tests and our QA is just manual
* Very hirachical. PM is seen as the boss. Engineers are not encouraged to help come up with the best solutions or show initiatives. They even see collaboration to solve problems as a weakness of the PM.
* Senior Engineers are:
   * not interested in collaboration and they see it as their job to just do as they were told 
   * don't become better at communication and project management (even technical tasks/tickets stay empty or have very little content, managers get ask to write tickets for technical task)
* People are being blamed (""xyz team is responsible"", ""they are too slow"", ""design wasn't detailed enough"", ""it's not my job"", ""he didn't reply"") or things are escalated for being missing
* People do not ask questions during refinement and things get implemented that logically make no sense
* Engineering seems disconnected from company goals/user needs

Hi, guys.

As a foreigner, I'm not very fluent in English writing, especially in the CV part. 

And asking someone to review my short self introduction requires lots of money. 

Also, I want to consult with more precious advices from expereinced software programmers like you.

So please advise me how to refine the self introduction part. 

Self intro:

Hi, I’m Lucas. After getting my master degree from NCU(ranking 501 from CWUR in 2019), I went to design Android app and web for a WiFi music box. After providing the convenient interfaces and rich media functions like online radio and local music, our products became more attractive to the customers and this increased the chip sales in the market.

After that, I joined in a web design team and my main role is to create new services. I developed a web interface to operate on the surveillance devices and manage the user permissions. I also added a log function to track users' behaviour. This working experience helps me a lot in the web development.

In my third position, I worked as an Android developer to develop a live streaming app which helps sell products. 

Now, I work for myself. I’m building a simple ERP system for private schools and small shops. Python and Django are used for the backend. And of course, html/js/css are used for the frontend. 

When I was not in office, I always go to mountain climbing and jogging. During the process of physical training, I felt stronger both in my body and mind. It always helps to me keep ongoing.

With years of experiences in web development, I’m seeking for more part time opportunities.

"Something that’s been really irking me in this past week since the GPT4 arrival is the onslaught of misinformed people blabbing about its role in automation SWE/Dev positions. I think it comes from a lack of understanding on how modern day workforces work, and how software like this can improve our productivity. GPT, like literally any other aid is used to increase productivity. An engineer multitasking with an AI is all the more productive than one who isn’t. So why would a massive industry shrink the pool of an INSTANTLY more productive workforce. The argument makes zero sense. All AI can do is just raise the limits of what engineers can do.

"Vulnerabilities can be hidden everywhere in a container. Every layer of the image can pose a security risk, making container images a substantial security concern.

While there are various commercial vulnerability scanning tools available, Mergify found that most of them could not manage the vulnerability lifecycle effectively. They turned to open-source security scanners and found Trivy to be useful in solving the vulnerability lifecycle problem.

Trivy generates a file that includes all the CVEs that affect the image, which can be committed to the repository to track vulnerabilities over time. The workflow that Mergify implemented is to run an image scan every day, create a pull request with the changes detected, merge automatically if there are no new CVEs, and comment on the pull request if new CVEs are detected. This workflow helps to track the different scans done over time, making vulnerability lifecycle management easy for the engineers at Mergify.",SoftwareEngineering,970,151

"Dear  newly appointed engineering managers, congratulations on this  exciting  milestone in your career! As you transition from being a  developer to a  manager, here are some tips to help you succeed:

\-   Make sure you understand where members of your team are professionally   and where they want to be. Try to assign them task that help them get   there, to the extent possible. For example, if you have a full stack   developer that has recently done a lot of frontend but now wants to dive   more into the backend, try to set him with relevant tasks.

\-  Don't  be afraid to delegate tasks and empower your team members to  take  ownership of their work. At this stage you're used to doing  everything  by yourself, cause it may be ""the fastest path"". Don't be  tempted to  doing that, it'd make you not have enough time to make sure  the team is  in the right direction, and would cut your team's wings. If  you always  do that specific thing that only you know, no one else  would never know  how to do it. Now is the time to teach others how to  do things you used  to do. You shouldn't ever be a bottleneck.

\-  Communicate your  expectations clearly and transparently with your  team, and make sure to  actively listen to their feedback. If you need  something ready by some  date, make sure you let them know this as you  assign the task. If you  want them to do something with a specific tech  stack or in a specific  way, let them know to help them save time and  not wander in areas where  you know they shouldn't go. Of course, do so  while being open to their  thoughts, perhaps they think of a better way?  that's where their  feedback is important.

\-  Foster a no-ego culture within the team.  Make sure they know you  always want to hear their opinion, especially  when it contradicts  yours. Let them know you know you're not perfect, no  one person is  always right. You want to hear it when they think you're  wrong in  something. In cases where you are indeed wrong you can save  your team  crucial time just by hearing other opinions.  
\- Celebrate  wins and  learn from failures as a team. Just finished a version?  celebrate!  something went wrong in production? learn what exactly lead  to it and  how you can improve as a team in the future to avoid this.

Best   of luck on this exciting new journey! I know this transition may be   overwhelming, so I am here for you if you have any questions about   anything. feel free to ask questions :)",SoftwareEngineering,2477,443

"Hello everyone,

I'm a software engineer seeking advice on how to navigate my career path. I have experience with Golang, Python, and JavaScript, but I don't have a degree. I decided to switch careers at the beginning of 2022 and completed a 12-week software engineering immersive program in May 22 with some preparation. I spent about five weeks on my own grinding LeetCode and found a job as a software engineer in a startup in June 22 (a friend referred me, and I did really well on my interview - I solved array and binary search problems). I was mostly working with React, but I didn't enjoy the job very much. Since it was low-paying and low-stress, I dedicated all my free time to learning as much as I could about CS foundations and backend systems. I stayed there until the new year, because in December, I passed a pretty long backend apprenticeship interview at another company (node service as home test, 5h on site coding, ood, system design). In January, I started an apprenticeship in a new company, which has provided me with more opportunities to learn and improve. My main issue is that it can be stressful at times, and there is little help provided from my peers (they are overwhelmed with their workloads from my point of view). While working in this job, I have learned a lot about backend foundations, AWS services, and picked up a new language (Golang), which I really value, and I know it is going to help me in the long term. However, due to recent layoffs (12% of employees), I am unsure about my future at this company. My current apprenticeship is ending in a week, and instead of a full-time conversion, I was offered an eight-week extension with no promise.

I would love to hear any advice or insights from the community on what steps I should take next to continue building my career in software engineering. How should I approach this? Should I continue to work at this company and hope for a conversion, or should I start looking for new opportunities elsewhere? What areas should I focus on improving in my skillset to make myself more marketable to potential employers? Should I start brushing up my leetcode? (I am comfortable with easy’s and mediums with more basic data structures, meaning there’s a lot of room for improvement!)

"My friend was recently contacted by a software company and accused of using a pirated copy of their product but the truth is the previous owner of the PC deleted it when he found out the product was pirated version. However, it looks like there was some remnant files that were left in the PC during the deletion and that has been phoning home to the software company any time my friend opens the computer. My questions are several: 

* Obviously the program was deleted and yet the software company was receiving calls from some remnant file in the computer left after the deletion. And so I wish to know, can a pirated software still ping/phone home to mother company even when deleted?
* My completely layman's understanding of how software systems call home from a computer is that the specific program needs to be opened in the computer before it can phone home. In this case, the program wasn't opened because it had been deleted. And so my question is, can software still phone home from a computer without being opened?
* Third, when a company engineers a software so that a pirated version sends signals/calls to mother company from a user's Pc, does the company have a way to find out when that software is deleted by the user? In other words will they know the exact time the software is deleted from a user's system? Because in the case of my friend, the software in question was deleted almost a year ago yet the company claims he was using it and wants him to buy a copy or face legal consequences.
* Does the software company have a legal case in this situation?",SoftwareEngineering,1577,286
"I've decided that I needed to change jobs so I could move closer to friends and family.  Part of this of course involves finding a new job.  


I spent 4 years in college studying computer science back in 2005-2008.  At the tail end of my college life, I got a ""summer job"" at a small oil and gas service company.  I started with small projects writing code in Excel VBA and C# (something I learned I loved in a game programming class).  Eventually this leads to larger applications to handle datasets and statistics, automatic report generation and data interpretation.  And not going back to college.  


Our company was purchased by a large corporation about 7 years in my tenure and most of us moved out of state to merge with a larger lab.  I pretty much kept doing the same thing, automating where I could with the tools I was familiar with: Visual Studio, C#, WinForms.    


The caveat to all this is I've been in my own bubble, working alone.  I do collaborate with all the end users to develop decent software, both UI and the underlying technology.  But I haven't worked on a team, and looking at these listings on Indeed with ""RESTful API"" and the other languages, cloud technology, etc. I feel like a dinosaur.  I am definitely willing to learn whatever is needed, but my lease is up the end of April and need to figure this out sooner than later.

I'm not a Cryptographer, nor am I a Quantum Computation Engineer, as much as I wish I could wake up one morning as someone else... So, I came across an article on IBM's website, which will get it's due [credit.](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/what-is-quantum-safe-cryptography-and-why-do-we-need-it) &lt;=====Right there.

Anyway, this is just a little piece of advice for anyone listening, Bad-Actors exist. They might be your neighbors for all you know. Ya, that sweet lady in her late 70's is probably trying to scam you somehow, believe it. But that's not news. You knew that already.

Here's the news, quantum mechanics is compleeeexxxx, but I cracked enough of it to know it's more dangerous than any bomb we've ever built. And you add unregulated, unfettered advancements in AI to the quantum realm, hell you set AI upon the task of cracking the mysteries of the quantum realm, and the speed of our advancement exceeds the most imaginative child's wildest dreams. It sounds like Sci-Fi, it really does. It's [here](https://quantum-computing.ibm/) though, if you're interested.

Quantum entanglement, all by it's lonesome, forces us to question the laws that govern our every-day lives. Two particles, entangled, can share the physical properties like spin, position, and polarization, to name a few, across any distance. In theory this happens instantaneously, in practice we utilize this to create quantum computers, and who knows what else...

So, to get back on track: I'm warning you all!!! ahhh, queue the ominous music and scary noises. Quantum computing is available for individuals to start learning, and someone with enough intelligence, information, and determination could probably build one at home. Other countries are undoubtably on the quantum train too. My point is this, quantum algorithms can crack the best of our encryptions quick enough to make any hacker gasp.

Now, I don't know how many passwords you've entered today, but imagine every system you tried to log into was shut down. Shit, Google's Search Engine was down. That would be the start of something catastrophic right? Even a day of that would send people into a panic. Quantum safe cryptography is the only way to prevent quantum abuse of classical computation systems. Perhaps not the only way, and perhaps that's not a fool-proof method of data security. I mean after-all, the quantum realm implies some odd connectivity of everything... Theories be damned for the moment, I need to make this plea sociologically, to the human in you. We need people researching in this field, we need Quantum Engineers to lend some of their thought to the problems of safely transitioning into a Quantum Era. It will change things, and it's coming a hell of a lot faster than most of you think.",SoftwareEngineering,2773,446

"Hi all, let me know if this is off topic but I need some input. Backstory: I work for a small software startup in which I am the 5th employee and the newest hire.

3 non technical bosses a 1 fully remote dev, well call him Dave. 

 I spearheaded a redesign of our database; it was ridiculously setup and I proposed a new schema to our singular developer and he took it well.

now I have been tasked with redesigning our GUI given the restructuring of the database. Therefore. I've asked my non-technical bosses if I could have access to github to see the code for our software so I can have a better understanding of how it's all set up. 

They talked to the dev Dave. He seemed very off and made every excuse about why he doesn't want to share (for the record, nobody has ever seen it.) I suggested just giving me view access in github so there's no chance I alter anything, and that I won't waste his time by asking questions. 0 downside. He convinced my boss that he should only have access. To me this makes no sense and I think he's hiding something.

I think Dave the dev might be intentionally working very slowly and taking home a huge salary, and lying about his logged hours. My non technical bosses are very naive and have no idea how dev projects actual take so they take him at his word. Does this seem likely to be true? Is it normal for a dev to want to have nobody else understand/ see their code?

"I recently did an interview for what I believed was a software engineering graduate role (UK) essentially a two year role. 

My degree is in Mechanical engineering and I do not have any previous software engineering experience. I decided I want to be a software engineer so recently began joining boot camps and learning basic coding in Python.


The interview was not very technical they seemed to be assessing our soft skills more (group and individual). Everyone else was a computer science grad with a lot of experience.  However I asked lots of questions about training and they highlighted they have a big budget for training and even one of the managers said they had very little coding experience when they started.

I got an offer and the exact role title they’ve given is associate consultant. I was just wondering if an associate consultant would have completely different responsibilities to a grad/entry level software engineer. I don’t want to be shunted off to a role that is not technical at all especially since I will be there for two years.

Hello, I will do my best to keep this concise and brief. 

I am 27/m with a wife and three children and live in the Midwest. I am a full time Journeyman Industrial Mechanic for one of the big three American Automakers. I have a significant amount of down/free time at work which has allowed me to pursue higher education. I currently am attending University of Maryland Global Campus. This fall I will be going into my 2nd year of undergrad. Now I will get to my question(s).. 

My initial plan was to transfer to Oregon State University this fall as a full time online student for their BS in CS, and to finish my degree in 3 years. I planned to transfer there because from what I've read, they seem to have a more rigorous and respected program compared to UMGC. Recently I discovered that UMGC is accepting training from my time in the military as 30 elective credit hours. In doing so, my degree would only take 2 years to complete, compared to 3 years at OSU. 

To get to my point: 

I am a full time working adult, with a family in children, and I work in a unrelated career field. So internships/co-ops are off the table. My goal with obtaining my degree is to learn as much as possible and become as prepared   As possible to change careers. My degree is not to check a box. 

Should I stick to my original plan of 3 years of education at OSU in their CS program, or should I finish an accelerated path at UMGC and try to get into the field a year sooner? Both degrees would be a BS in CS. I would still take all major and gen ed requirements. I would take little to no electives at UMGC, and would take 30 credit hours of electives at OSU. 

Neither school cost me anything because of my GI Bill and employer tuition assistance. 

Being in the Midwest, does either school hold more weight over the other? 

Since I have no work experience in this field, would OSU program prepare me more than UMGC? Or would UMGC prepare me enough and I should start working sooner?

" When  you're working for a company and your pull requests are approved, how  is the code integrated to the production software? As far as I know,  it's now on the main branch, but how does that code reach the users?

Are  there any sources online that cover what practices, or processes, that  companies follow on how they work with production code? (Which may vary  depending on their software development process.)

Do  you just have a local repository at your production server that pulls  from the main branch on the remote repository on a scheduled basis?

Or  is it the same as mine, have someone that just manually copies code  from the main branch to the server and run scheduled tasks to run each  script?

I have to ask, as these questions have been festering in my mind for quite some time.

At  my small-ish company (I'm the only developer, IT guy, Help Desk, etc.),  all code is written and pushed through git and any code / script  changes pulled to the main branch is manually copied over, by me, to our  production server. At our production server, I just have a task  scheduler that runs these scripts on a scheduled basis.

"I joined a small startup as a software engineer about a year ago. Our engineering team is me, one other engineer, and the CTO. We have a fairly small code base for a web app, consisting of an express.js api and a react client. They started building the app 4-5 years ago and the CTO probably wrote ~50% of the code that remains today. 

When I joined, they had just begun converting to typescript from JavaScript, there were zero tests for anything (not even unit tests!), they committed directly to main/master constantly and barely ever used PRs or code reviews, and deployments were handled by the CTO running a command from his personal laptop and crossing his fingers that he set all of his environment variables correctly.

Fast forward to today, and we’ve converted about half of the code to typescript, we started writing unit tests and the api is at about 30% coverage (client still has zero tests), 100% of our infrastructure is now IaC (terraform), we use a linter and code formatter, we’re tracking issues with linear, we’ve adopted standard git workflows, we have a proper deployment pipeline that enabled us to convert our app into a SaaS product that we have running in half a dozen different environments (generating WAY more revenue now), and we have status pages that continuously monitor for downtime.

All of these improvements happened because I begged the CTO for them. My CTO is very intelligent, he’s a fast learner, and I genuinely enjoy working with him (and I believe that feeling is mutual), but he has some awful coding habits and a lot to learn. For example, pretty much every page on the client is a single, 1000 line function. No components that we can reuse… just massive files that are next to impossible to understand.

The CTO reviews most PRs, but he approves pretty much anything you submit, so the other engineer’s code is typically just as bad as the CTO’s. I’m honestly not sure if they don’t know how to write maintainable code, or if they just don’t care, but I can’t continue working on their buggy shit spaghetti code forever - it’s not any fun. I also don’t think anyone else has a clue how bad the code quality is because our CEO frequently states that we have “3 very senior engineers.” (The CEO is also a coder, but he’s very junior)

What advice do you have? How do I tactfully tell my boss (CTO) that he’s been writing shit code for 4 years and I need him to stop doing that? How common is this problem, really? Is this just how startups go? Should I just find a job somewhere else?",SoftwareEngineering,2533,453
"Hi everyone,

I have been working as an Agile coach for the past 8 years. In my current organization, we do not have proper feedback culture and I have a question about how can we provide sufficient feedback to the engineers. Please notice that a year ago we have added internal code reviews which have been proven to work exceptionally well.

Our goal is to provide a process or tool that will assist them to improve their Technical (mainly) and Soft skills.

So far we have seen various 360 tools, however, I am afraid that this is not the ideal way for assessing technical skills, skills specific to an individual project, or granular performance indicators, since it typically involves many people with different backgrounds and levels of involvement with the reviewer.

360-degree feedback may be too subjective to assess some aspects of a software engineer’s performance.

I have changed jobs a few times but in all my jobs I am just a doer. I mean by the time I joint a team, an existing app has been written and all what I do is adding new features or fixing bugs. I mean it's still challenging from time to time but once I am used to the codebase and domain, then it's not challenging at all.

The difference is not that one goes to an IIT institution and the other does not. The only difference is that one knows that they have infinite potential and the other does not know that they also have infinite potential.

When I was in college, I used to think this a lot. What are the things that make IIT so special. Why are so many students running behind it. Are the faculties so good? But non iitian institutions also have good faculties. Is the course structure better? But many have the same course as well. Are the hotel facilities, food, classrooms better? Are the practical labs better? You can find ample examples denying this. Then why are sooo many students dying to go to those colleges.

I am in one of the FAANG right now, and I know the answers now. My company is filled with both IITians and non IITians and the only similarity they have is that they all know that they have the potential to do anything, they have the power even to change this world. I have never seen an IITian doubting themselves if they are capable of doing something or not. They are very sure, they will do it. 

If every student understands that they are also capable of doing wonders, they are not different from those who study in a different building, holding a tag of IIT with them, then it will solve many problems. The main cause of a lack of self confidence comes mainly from our homes. In India, most parents don’t have trust and confidence in their children. They have seen their loved ones, doing stupid stuffs when they were young, and they don’t expect them to change much when they are in their 20s. They train their kids to secure a job, big enough to survive with the inflation. There were not many job opportunities for us a few decades ago, but we can do whatever we want and achieve anything we can think of today. 

Many fear from dreaming big. I am not sure what they are even afraid of. There is no tax on thinking big yet. If we will not consider planning about being a better person, better than what a non-iitian mentality person can even think of, then we will never be able to grow. If you are reading this, trust me, you have infinite potential and I really mean it. You just need to ask yourself how to utilize this potential.",SoftwareEngineering,2250,416

"So I recently passed a 1st stage interview and now im onto my 2nd stage which is a technical test. The test isnt like what ive seen before, from experience, they'd give basic tasks involving algorithms and arrays. This, however, is asking me to build an address book web application, implementing a front and backend (they havent used these terms though). I have the knowledge to do it and frankly its fairly easy, just time consuming. 

One point though is theyve asked us to do it fully object oriented. Now im using purely javascript for this as it the language I know very well, more specifically React.js and Node.js. I know all they want from this is to check if I understand OOP, which im confident I do, just I cant find a place where OOP is needed. 

The backend will just be API endpoints which I will be using express to implement. I could potentially implement some sort of OOP with the data but really only one class could be used as the only data we have recieved is a 4 element JSON array with keys: firstname, lastname, phone, email. I cant really use any OOP techniques such as abstraction, inheritance, interfaces, etc because the data set is so small. 

Finally we come to react, ive already got a front end implemented but ive done it functionally as thats what ive learnt and also be told to use on the internet. Furthermore, ive been told the devs of react want you to start using functions rather than classes as many of these class properties and features are being depricated.

Further points that may be useful, this is for a graduate role and have said they dont expect us to know everything. Im just worried that it will ruin my chances becuase I didnt really implement and OOP becuase there was no need for it.

"Hi everyone,

I'm a reasonably experienced programmer (15+ years of C/C++, C#, Java, PHP, JS, Unity and more). However, the first half of this period was spent working in research labs supporting one-off prototypes for experiments (in academia but also for a couple of big companies) and the next bit has been teaching undergrads on an arts-based technology programme that doesn't delve too much into software engineering.

The result is, while I can write code pretty well across a load of languages and technologies, my knowledge of contemporary software development practices is pretty rusty. I use Git, but not much beyond add, commit, push, pull and, rarely, branch. I have touched on containers, but only really to replace MAMP for simple local development. I've not written a unit test since my degree 20 years ago! Dev ops, that's the people who do... umm. The Cloud, someone else's computer, but what food do I need to give my Kubernetes and does it need a daily walk? You get the idea :-).

Out of interest more than anything, I'm really keen to find out more about contemporary software development and engineering practices though.

"I am starting a new project and just trying to spend the extra time to think about the system as a whole to get things lined out ahead of time. I'm not sure exactly how to approach this challenge listed below and just looking for general advice or to be pointed to appropriate resources.

Overall concept: It's a multi-user platform(web app) that will allow the end-user to get data from multiple apis(depending on specific desire) through a portal, the data will be combined to make something more useful and convenient for the user. 

Problem: Should I use something like Kong or Tyk being as each individual api request will need to be rate limited depending on how many credits the end-user has pre-purchased. Also, some the api's will need to be fired off in sequence in some scenarios, and the data from the response of api A may be needed to send along with subsequent requests. 

Just to satisfy curiosity, this platform will fall into B2B/SEO industry. 

So, I guess my question more specifically is this, will something like Kong or Tyk fulfill most of these needs or will I be better off starting from the ground up? Also, this platform will be built in the context of Node.js backend most likely, although I have not ruled out using python as of yet, I just have more experience with js.",SoftwareEngineering,1299,230

"One of the difficulties in debugging is to either fetched the logs (which is a long process involving Devops) or asking the user or QA to share the steps to reproduce the bug. Or the developers themselves use the breakpoints to analyze what caused the code to break.

I am working on an observability tool for developers. Idea behind it is:

* to uncover the data/object flows
* identify the anomalies in the data as it moves from one class/method to another(this will observe data for sometime to find all the possible combinations, it will raise an alert if there would be difference in data). 
*  uncovering which method takes the most time etc. 
* Flow visualization can also be used as a form of documentation of ever changing code base and understanding the undocumented part of the code. 

Moreover, I also plan to add a functionality of ""indexing"" the codebase allowing developers to search the logic/flows of their choice - for eg how the app behaves for user A (lets say a stripe) as compared to user B(appstore user) and output should be complete flow end to end.

"[Toolbox](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/toolbox/), offered by the Fedora Project, attempts to help developers achieve reproducible builds isolated from system configuration.

Like Docker, it uses OCI for isolation from the host operating system, but simplifies integration with the host, for example, by importing a user's home directory. However, unlike the patterns promulgated in the Dockerverse, Containers are built over a complete base system, with additional tools added interactively. It does not depend on an application-specific `Dockerfile`. Rather, it allows a user to configure a build environment normally, yet without changing the host, thus offering a hybrid between full container isolation and fully-local operations.

At the moment, communities beyond Fedora, such as Debian, Ubuntu, and so on, have not adopted it. There are no binaries or packages available for targets of these kinds.

"Do you have experience working with anyone who writes a lot of code, seemingly without any consideration for maintainability, flexibility, or reuse? I don't know how many times if looked back at systems I have carefully designed, only to find if statements hacked in to bypass normal functionality only because they didn't want to be bothered with trying to understand how it works. They just want to implement functionality quickly as they can.

These people seem to often be admired by management for having a reputation for getting things done, but they jeopardize the long term success of the project. The best analogy I can think of would be if a race car driver was admired for how fast he can drive, but he's constantly grinding gears and the transmission eventually siezes up. The people in charge don't know how to judge the quality of code, so they don't who is responsible for tanking productivity and grinding a project to a hault.

It becomes more frustrating when management wants to reuse functionality, and then you look to find that it is so tightly coupled to a specific use case that everything that had been done now needs to be ripped out and rewritten and management doesn't understand why it's so complicated. Often it seems that code is degrading faster than anyone can do anything about, and now there are so many convoluted special cases and branching mazes of inconsistent logic that nobody can even be begin to understand it. To avoid unintended side effects of changes, people just sprinkle in more if statements to alter the behavior of code in dozens of places.

What can be done about this? There seems to be developments who think they are good at their jobs because of how much code they write, or because of how many years they have been doing it, but they never seemed to have learned anything about software architecture the entire time they have been working. I think this is a major problem in software development that you don't hear mentioned very often.

We do code reviews of pull requests, but often people mess with systems other teams are responsible for and then they don't wind up finding out about changes until weeks later. The people doing the reviews don't understand how it works, so often all anyone can do is a superficial check of the code for things like spelling errors or immediately apparent bugs. Because people are overwhelmed with their own work, they just wind up approving code changes they dont understand just to keep things moving.

What can be done to reign in the chaos and get everyone on the same page with how things should be done? It's like if home contractors were building a house and they have a lot of people thinking things like, ""the plumbing is already installed in the kitchen, so the easiest thing to do would be to attach a hose to the sink and place the toilet on top of the counter."" Then the entire house gets hacked together in that same sort of way -- with loose wires dangling all over the place, rooms that are inaccessible because the doors had been removed, boxes stacked upon boxes that would put a hoarder to shame, the roof leaks, and tenets constantly complain about fires spontaneously arising.

It's like watching a slow motion train wreck going over a waterfall.",SoftwareEngineering,3263,570

"This is based on my own experience and how I have been taught agile engineering. I would like to make a few points about how I think agile is slowing down software development, and would be very glad about any friendly discussion on the issue.

For background, I taught myself programming, I worked on hobby projects alone, and only later came in touch with the industry and education around programming.

From the very beginning, I felt a big dissence about how academics and managers expected programmers to work, and how I felt to be working most productively. When I went to Uni I had a bit of a hard time accepting the Project Management side of the Software Engineering course, because I felt it didn't really address the issues programmers have during development.

With time and experience I learned that a lot of that ideology and education revolves around making *teams* work on projects, and that it was not directly linked to programming itself. However it was still presented as a solution to programming issues, which I just really couldn't submit to.

Basically I have been taught to ""not plan ahead"" and to ""not design anything you might not need"". The counter-example to agile development has always been the waterfall-model, where you plan it all out ahead, implement your design and then test it at the end. The issue given was that any failed tests caused a redesign in basically all of the previous architecture.

Agile is supposed to avoid this by implementing small increments, testing them, and iteratively approaching a solution. Another argument for this was that it is easier to react to changes in the requirements from clients. Overall, it is supposed to be more flexible and hence, agile.

To me this seemed to create a lot of friction for me as a programmer-first. If I am not supposed to make assumptions about the future or make any designs that take longer than one or two weeks, how can I be sure it is even any good? 

Just now I am working on a project, and I believe I have stumbled into this very problem. I have been working on this code for a few years now, and I have tried to integrate what I have learned into the way I work. I try to find simple solutions instead of overengineering things.

But I keep finding that my implementations are way too naive and don't really address the real underlying issue, and I end up having to scrap parts of my code because it simply isn't really needed. I had suspicions of a more complex approach before, but because of fear of overengineering, I said, ""screw it, I will just implement the simple version and see how it goes"". Turns out, the simple version doesn't really solve the full problem and I can basically rewind and implement the complex solution.

I think this is a great misunderstanding of the agile ideology. Maybe there are times where teams can get stuck in an ""analysis paralysis"" and if you don't know what you need to implement, it might be helpful to experiment and implement something akin to a prototype. But teaching engineers ""not to design"" or ""plan ahead"" in order to stay ""agile"" just seems like a bad idea. Software is incredibly complex and requires a lot of design and planning ahead.

If your requirements change mid-way then you should expect having to redesign. It is not the job of the engineer to adapt to constantly changing requirements, at least not in every environment.

I think by being so focussed on being flexible the team ceases to be productive. Because we want to be fast, we don't take time to think about the problem and all of its corner cases. We don't dare to create a big, complex design that would address all cases properly, because we need to worry that everything can change in a few weeks. So we just implement a naive solution and are left with buggy code.

I would be interested in your opinions on this. I for one will take more time with my designs in the future and make sure I have exhausted every idea before I implement something half-baked..",SoftwareEngineering,3990,706

In the era of technology, mobiles have become unavoidable and they are the most widely used device in the world. Mobiles are full of apps, but the security of the apps has become a concern for users. Due to the momentous rise in cyber attacks, developing an app that is completely safe to use is a crucial component in mobile app development. This ensures an uncomplicated business operation. Previously,  mobile apps are mostly used for entertainment and social media, but now the time has changed they are used for various purposes including payment processes.

## Checklist to Secure Your Mobile Apps for 2023

Most apps now we use collect our behavioral data in the background. Hence you need to prioritize mobile app security more than anything in your next mobile app development. So how do you keep your personal and business data protected from such cyber attacks? No worries, in this blog we will guide you about mobile app security. Below we have given the complete checklist to secure your mobile app.

### Code Signing Certificate to Secure your Mobile App

The most vulnerable are open-source software. Cybercriminals have no trouble attacking these applications. By including a code signing certificate into your software, you may avoid these cyber-attacks. To make the app resistant to cyber criminals, the software code should be intact and safe, with a code signing certificate to avoid virus multiplication.

However, it is critical to store your signing code certificate in a secure location to avoid attackers looking for the security code. You can also keep your files secure by using non-intruding and unique passwords. Symantec code signing certificate, Comodo code signing certificate, and Sectigo code signing certificate are a few well-known code signing certificates.

## Multi-factor Authentication(MFA)

(MFA) is one of the essential factors to secure your mobile apps from cyber attacks. MFA is an authentication procedure that requires to user to provide more than one verification factor to access the target resources. The widely used authentication process only asks the user to provide a username and password, but in the case of MFA the user to need complete additional verification factors.

This can be a combination of OTP, biometric verification, calls and security questions. It ensures no one can use your device except you and can take the required measures if a cyber attack happens.

## Encrypt Mobile Communication

As the usage of cellular and wifi networks increases, cyber attacks through these channels have become very common. So encrypting the communication between mobile servers is inevitable. Powerful encryption and SSL keys like 4096, can stop the cyber attackers from decrypting the data. It is equally important to encrypt your devices as encrypting the traffic. As far as ultra-sensitive data is concerned, it is important to safeguard data from being downloaded to the end user’s device.

## Runtime App self-protection

Runtime application self-protection is an emerging technology that stops cyber attackers from attempting to hack your application and steal your data. RASP technology can be built into your application to prevent real-time attacks and detect vulnerabilities. RASP is capable of detecting, blocking, and mitigating attacks. This technology can protect your application from data without human intervention.

## Install Tamper-Detection tools

Various technologies can detect when the app code is modified and can give warnings. Therefore, you need to develop an app in a way that can give warnings when the code is changed. The leading tampering strategy is an injection, including alteration in java code and transformation in code. These tamperings can be controlled by the tamper identification software. This software can stop malware from replicating and causing further harm to your application.

## Secure Application Programming Interface

Application programming interfaces are responsible for integrating third-party services. API facilitates the systems to interconnect for data exchange and boosting functionality. An unsecured API is always vulnerable and the data exchanged can be decrypted by the attackers. To ensure the security of the application, conduct API security testing.

## Static Application Security Testing(SAST)

Static analysis is a testing strategy, that is capable of analyzing application code and security loopholes of your mobile application. Static application security testing can investigate the application before the code is compiled and can discover unauthorized access. Apktool, Cydia, and App track are some of the tools used in static application security testing.

## Prevent Data Leaks 

Mobile users tend to install various apps on their devices without knowing their authenticity. It is important to isolate each app from one another to avoid data leaks. This restricts the malware from accessing sensitive information. The possible way for preventing data leaks are 

* Restrict screen capture
* Watermark malicious files with usernames
* Stop copy and paste function
* Restrict users from downloading confidential files.

## Summing up

To summarise, cyber attacks by hackers have become increasingly widespread in recent years. Even the most secure systems can be hacked. As a result, if you are intending to design a mobile application for your business, it is critical to remember that security is the most significant component in protecting your sensitive data from hackers. Consider following the above-mentioned security checklist to avoid losing your data to cybercriminals.

As more people use the internet for many purposes, including web searches, having a safe and secure website has become more important than ever. You may think, why would someone hack into a small business’s website, but the truth is small business websites are most vulnerable to cyber-attacks. An unsecured website is always dangerous for you and your website visitors. As a website owner, you need to protect your website from hackers. Fortunately, there are a variety of things you can do to protect your website from cyber-attacks. Below, we will start with some basic steps to secure your website from hackers.

## 1. Use safe and strong passwords:

The first step in safeguarding your website is to create a secure password. All of the websites are password-protected. However, the strength of the password is crucial. Choose a password that is both strong and difficult to guess. A strong and secure password includes a mix of upper and lower case letters, symbols, signs, and numbers. Tools like a password manager can help you create strong and secured passwords.

## 2. Install security plugins

If you built your website with content management systems like WordPress, Magento, Drupal, and Wix, you can improve the website security by installing security plugins. These plugins are capable of protecting your website from cyber-attacks to some extent. Most of the CMS platforms come with free security plugins. Some of the plugins are listed below

* Sucuri security
* iTheme security
* Wordfence security
* Patchstack

## 3. Use HTTPS-SSL certification

HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is a security protocol used to secure websites. The lock icon next to the web address indicates that the site is secured. The site is secured with the SSL certification. SSL certification encrypts the data transfer between the server and the visitor’s browser. This accreditation is required for websites that need payment procedures and sensitive data. Search engines such as Google regard websites that lack SSL certification to be insecure. Secure your website with SSL certification if you want people to trust it.

## 4. Use secure cookies

This feature adds a layer of security between the server and the website visitor. The data information in the encrypted cookies is safer from hackers. Secure cookies may only be transferred via an SSL connection, hence the website must be SSL certified to use them.

## 5. Update your software and website platform regularly:

Updating your software and the operating system keeps your website running smoothly. These updates contain new security patches. Most of the updates require only a system restart and installation process. Website owners mostly ignore these updates, but this is a dangerous practice that can even lead to losing your website. Thus, you should install these updates to secure your entire system.

## 6. Secure your site from SQL injection

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a type of code that manages and allows people to search for information in your site databases. But the (SQL) is often misused by hackers. Hackers insert specific codes into your database to manipulate and steal data from your site. Hackers get in through URL parameters and form fields to damage the databases. This is called an SQL attack. To secure your website from SQL attacks set up parameterized queries and create secure forms.

## 7. Limit user permission and access

A website is nothing but a set of folders and files stored in your web hosting account. These are the files responsible for the proper functioning of the site. Hackers can access these files to steal sensitive data from your website. Limit the user’s permission to read, write and execute any changes in the file. Use a strong and secure password for your account. You can also set security permissions to these files and folders. Ensure every user follows all the preventive security measures before accessing these files and folders.

## 8. Backup your site regularly:

All websites, regardless of size or value, are vulnerable to data theft. In the event of a website hack, the worst-case scenario is losing all of your data. To keep your website safe, make regular backups. If you have a recent backup, recovering your website is significantly easier. You could also consider purchasing an automatic backup solution. The automatic backup mechanism can back up your website without your intervention.

# Conclusion

With the rise in cyber crimes, leaving your website without any protection can destroy site data. Most importantly, recovering your website may cost you a lot of money. So give the most priority to secure your website especially, if you run an online business.

Implement the above steps to secure your website from cyber-attacks and data breaches.

The one crucial ingredient underpinning our transition to a digital-first economy, more than any other, is software. That’s why software engineering has become one of the world’s most in-demand professions. In the UK alone, the median salary for the role has increased 13% year-over-year as businesses look to stay ahead of the competition and attract the very best IT talent. But the high salary often isn’t consistent with where software developers stand in the business; many organizations
 still view them as suppliers rather than as crucial players in their success. Based on the current speed of transformation, we know that demand for software engineering is only going to increase. So business and technology leaders need to urgently consider vital cultural changes to help better integrate software development teams within the wider organization. But what exactly should they be?
communication, ways of working and integration between software developers and the wider business. It’s a dilemma that needs immediate attention if businesses are to remain at the competitive edge.

Developers are too often left to deal with huge monolithic pieces of work, which require them to write code for months on end without it being road-tested. This inevitably leads to mistakes that are found only once the updates have already been released to market creating a ripple effect throughout the organization. It’s an all-too-common scenario that demonstrates business leaders’ clear lack of clarity and understanding about the colossal value adopting a DevOps culture can deliver for the wider business, including its customers.

Take financial institutions looking to introduce a new offering, for example, such as a new mortgage product. Without a collective approach to development, getting the backend systems up and running for a product can take up to six months. But modularising the options and breaking down the functionality can shorten timelines to weeks.

Business leaders must look to create unified, cohesive and cross-functional teams that work together on projects that are broken down into simplified and localized components that can be easily integrated together without a negative impact on each other. It might seem like a small strategic change in working practices, but its impact on the speed and efficacy of software development can be enormous.
The role of the software engineer has changed; it is no longer about writing code in isolation without much regard for or knowledge of how it benefits the business. Developers work better when they have clarity about the direct impact their work will have on achieving business goals and on the bottom line. It’s down to business leaders to communicate these challenges and goals (in other words, understand the “why”) to help software developers understand what they’re trying to achieve. But doing so in a way that moves towards a better working culture requires a new approach to building and managing software development teams.

The first step is casting aside the negative stereotypes many have of software engineers and celebrating the intellectual and cultural diversity within their teams. Diversity of personnel brings a diversity of personalities, which is crucial to creating more inclusive cultures that accept and welcome all characters with open arms. While this may seem obvious, what is often overlooked is the impact diversity can have on stimulating and increasing innovation.",SoftwareEngineering,3465,539

"Hi everyone! I'm thinking of developing a (simple) app yet I'm nowhere near knowledgeable enough to tackle it without making several questions,  looking for input, and researching. My friends get together once a week to play a 7v7 soccer/football match yet they always complain that the teams are organized unjustly. I want to help with that with this ""app"".

Each friend would create a **Player** profile that will be given a score by every other **player** after the **Match** is over. The app should take the score of every player, add them, and divide them into two groups of about the same score thus creating two  balanced **Teams**; each team should also be randomized (but I'll tackle that later). The **Group** table is there because my friends could decide to play with other friends and not only between themselves

I wanted to know your opinions on the basic ERD I've put together and if there's anything meaningful I'm missing or any other type of input/suggestion/link-to-info/blogs/books you want to provide that I should be aware of or can make use of.

This is just to know if I'm thinking the structure correctly for when I write the java code.

I'm also thinking about adding a ""leader""/""admin"" role that would have matchmaking privileges inside the group (ie create matches). Should  I also add a **date** as a value of **Match** so that the program knows when to open the registration window to the match? Like it opens on a Sunday and the first 14 **Players** of the **Group** that enter before the **Match** starts can play the **Match**.

"So I just started my first year of software engineering and I'm basically feeling pretty lost with it all.

Programming has always seemed fun to me, but It's been a struggle knowing where to go with it. I've tried messing around with making games in unity on my own time, had some practice with cpp in highschool, and am learning 8086 assembly and C in my lectures now. 

While it's somewhat interesting learning the syntax for each language and learning dry theory upon theory. I'm struggling to see what I could do with it. I would love to try and apply what I learned in practice, but it's incredibly hard to know where to start with it and how to look for information on that.

Guess I'm just impatient with all the theory and I really want to try to work on some sort of project and just make something. Cause it feels like the lectures are going through all the information really slow and I would love to learn more, but I have no clue what that would be and where to start with it.


So I guess I would like to ask for:

   • What topics/concepts I could look into as a beginner that would help get me started 
   • Any online resources that aren't just explaining syntax of a language, but going into how to use it and what I could do with it
   • How you got started with programing, like how did you learn to go from simply knowing the language to making something with it 
   • How to be able to learn on my own 
   • Or just any opinions to this in general

"Maybe let me rephrase the question… Where in the world you can have the highest level of living? 

Of course, Bay Area is notoriously know for high salaries in IT, hitting $500k for senior programmers at FANG companies.
But SF comes also with one of the highest costs of living in the US.
For a decent living which would classify you as a higher middle class you’d need $250k/yr.
New York is a bit more affordable (still very expensive) but the salaries are typically $80-150k based on seniority.

If you work remotely, you can be based on some south-Asian island or in South American and your costs of living can be incomparably lower.
But after some time, you might find yourself lacking the (level of) services you were used, especially health care.

I live in Prague (Central Europe) where average average salary is $17k/yr. (coffee costs ~$2-$3) whilst the salaries in IT are hitting 6 figures!
This sets you for a luxurious live while having all the services and comfort of a mid European capital.
And Prague is fucking beautiful!!
I personally live at Walter Residency (premium living), have a private medical care (www.canadian.cz) with one of the clinics conveniently just before my apartment) and since a dinner in the best restaurant is $35, I don’t need to cook.

I’ve saw many websites such as glassdoor with some numbers I don’t think reflect the current situation.
I work as a Senior Data Scientist at a large consultancy firm and have an equivalent to $80k.
I’m currently open to new opportunities with a 6-figure salary or &gt;$400/MD and I’m getting those offers.
Also, the job listings I see online (such as NoFluffJobs) are often 6-figures.

"Fellow software engineers of Reddit, I want to pick your brains on a couple of things RE onboarding/joining a new development team, writing/reading architectural documentation, and creating diagrams.

1. How much of your time did you spend going through architecture documents, diagrams, etc. when onboarding to a new team? How helpful were the diagrams? If you ever had to make any docs/diagrams specifically for onboarding, how much time did it typically take you?

2. How much time do you spend creating design and other software related documents that exist outside of the core code/codebase? How often does this include making diagrams and how much time does the diagramming process typically take? What software do you use to create diagrams?

3. If you do not frequently create diagrams for documents, is it because it simply wouldn’t be useful or because it takes too much effort but would be useful?

4. How much time do you spend reading documentation created by others? Do you find diagrams noticeably improved your understanding/the efficacy of the document?

5. Where and how do you save and maintain diagrams e.g. embedded in your code repository or in docs external to it?

"Hey all,

Currently, I am a product manager looking after mobile apps. Before that, I was a data engineer in a BI team.

I had a really tough time debugging my code and that used to add a level of frustration during those days.

Everyone has a different style of learning, my preferred style is visualization. I always longed for an ideal tool that could:

* Actually store/log the event payloads at every step so I don't have to re-run it again. Someone could suggest debuggers/step points but in my case, I had to download the data from a third-party service, then perform intensive data cleaning operations, etc.
* allow me to choose and run a code snippet from anywhere in the repo in an isolated environment so I could check individual functions using the logged data.
* bring a level of visualization and transparency such that everyone can view and identify the problems(or at least improve efficiency).
* log failed payloads automatically so we dont have to implement logging during development

Now since i am a product manager, i am again facing a kind of frustration when our engineers couldn't reproduce a bug at their end and we have to wait for days and sometimes weeks. I think this problem is not just limited to app development or backend development (correct me if i am wrong).

"Hey all. Our team has been looking for tools for creating diagrams for our daily back-end engineering needs, such as tools for creating DB diagrams, high-level architecture / system designs, APIs and its contracts, etc.

We've been using quite a few web-based tools overall such as **Miro**, **Notion**, **Excalidraw**, **Diagrams.net** (former draw.io) and **dbdiagram.io**, and also **OpenAPI** for documenting our BFFs APIs.

Our main problem is that only OpenAPI is actually version-controlled and easy to share with our team, as it is located in the same Git repo as our actual APIs. It is version-controlled and shared by nature, as the code must be pushed to our repository.

Some of those tools also have sharing enabled through Google Drive, but its terribly wonky and most of our team would rather just take a screenshot of the diagrams than going through the hideous process of sharing their stuff. If that person leaves the company, we have to either recreate their diagrams from zero or just forget about it.

So we're basically looking for tools for:

* Relational DB schemas
* System design and high-level architecture
* Other similar use-cases

...that are:

* Version controlled (preferably through Git)
* Easy to share or shared by nature
* Group of people (company) has the ""ownership"" instead of relying on a single person
* (Optionally) Naturally generated or have the option to be exported as SVG (or even some proprietary text-based format)
* (Optionally) Do not rely on a single language or stack to work, as we work with multiple languages

"Hey y’all. Have someone of you ever worked with the above mentioned methodology?

POV. I just started working for a new client and the developer leads from there came up with this “great” idea, but I do not really see the point of having a bunch of devs seeing a screen while only one of them is doing all the work. Is it not better if each person of the team is working on a different task? It’s kinda boring too.

"Is there any software engineering job where quality and craftsmanship are valued above schedule and budget? 

That's the TL;DR. Long post follows:

I've worked in the aerospace industry for over 20 years. I'm passionate about software craftsmanship, clean code, readability, maintainability, attention to detail, and thorough testing. I dig deep into the requirements to really understand the system and all the edge cases. When I work with legacy code, I always make sure to understand it at a deep level, to make sure I'm using it and modifying it as the original designers intended. Because I dive deep into the details, and I'm obsessive about getting things right, it's not uncommon for me to find bugs or design flaws that other people couldn't figure out, or didn't know existed, for literally years. I also often find deficiencies in the requirements, such as edge cases that aren't covered, or just plain old mistakes. 

Of course, this means I'm not a very fast programmer. I can't just crank out code. When someone estimates how long a task will take, it usually takes me twice as long, because I raise a lot of questions that nobody else even thought of, and because I need to really understand what I'm doing before I can implement something. And, this kind of brain work takes a lot of energy, and I find that the older I get, the less energy I have, and it's hard to stay focused for 8 hours a day.

You would think the aerospace industry would be a place where attention to detail and quality are highly valued. However, I've worked on a lot of different projects at several different companies, and I've found that schedule and budget are always the main driving factors. And managers, who are mostly not software literate, just want things done quickly, and don't seem to care at all about quality. It seems to me that low-quality code will cost much more in the long run, when the bugs and deficiencies are found later, after delivery. But most of the managers I've worked with don't see it that way. They all focus on short-term schedules, not long-term quality.

When I ask deep questions, I can't tell you how many times I've been told, ""You don't need to know that"", or ""That's out of scope for your task"". However, the people who tell me that are usually proven wrong when it turns out that the questions I'm asking uncover a bug in the legacy code or a mistake in the requirements. And even when they don't, I know what information I need to know in order to do my job right. So I resent people who try to tell me what I do or don't need to know. Understanding the problem and the domain thoroughly always leads to better code, and it helps me to be much better equipped to handle the next problem in the same area. 

I honestly can't do my job if I don't understand what I'm doing completely. I can't just make a bunch of assumptions and move on - my brain doesn't work that way. And, in my 20+ years on the job, I've come across a lot of really crappy, unprofessional legacy code, which has taught me that the engineers who have come before me are not to be trusted. If some legacy code I'm using hasn't been tested and has no documentation, I can't just assume that it works. Often I don't even know what it's supposed to do, until I really dive into it and write my own tests for it.

Sometimes I think all these things mean I'm better at my job than most people. But more often I think it means I suck at my job. Because nobody seems to appreciate my skills. They just wonder why everything is taking me so long, and they get annoyed at all my questions. And it makes me wonder whether this attention to detail of mine is a skill or a disorder.

I wonder if it's possible to get a job where my kind of obsessive attention to detail is actually valued, and people would appreciate me taking the time to do the job thoroughly, no matter how long it takes. Any thoughts or ideas? Can anyone relate to my experience? Has anyone like me found a job where they're happy?",SoftwareEngineering,3994,730
"I have a strongly held view that's something I think is obvious - the kind of thing with which no one can argue.  However a few of my colleagues disagree with me, so it's leading me to question myself!  What do you think about the following:

Suppose you are given a json schema and your job is to create big files (several million lines) that contain json that is valid  under that schema.  You must code  in java.  *Which of the following would you do?*

* Use some software to generate an API that lets you create objects that match the schema. After creating an object, use an API method to serialize it to a json string, which will certainly be valid.  If no API generation software exists, write your own custom classes that do this using jackson or gson
* Study the schema to make sure you understand what it requires.  Get the schema creator to give you a big example as a guide.  Then create your json using lots of string operations.  Once you are done, run a validator to ensure that the result is valid in the given schema
* This much better approach ==&gt; .... !

My view is that the first approach is the right one. It's what I've done previously using XML, where we have jaxb for example.   So I don't see how json is any different.",SoftwareEngineering,1248,233

"Hi all

I'd like some experiences and suggestions of how people have organised a microservice project in jira and general pointers about approaches.

At work we're building a product with a restful microservices backend, and ideally we want those services to be reusable across other related parts of the business (of course with further development, but with a good foundation that isn't tied too closely to our current project). I've not really worked on developing microservices before, and I think it's fair to say there's not a huge amount of experience in the team in this as well. We own all of the services but don't have dedicated teams owning them at the moment.

The project to date has kind of been built top down - frontend is built and the other components (backend/s and a backend-for-frontend) are built alongside. Organising the testing has been a bit of a nightmare as the backends have little requirements other than ""make the frontend stuff work"" and we keep hitting hurdles and keep re-discussing ways to make this better.

If you think of the backend services like products themselves they should have their own requirements, a well-defined API design (at least at some level) and tests around that (including some integration tests between them and interacting systems) and should allow us to test more thoroughly and faster than if we tested through the whole stack. But this is an extra overhead of course.

On the other hand some are suggesting just building them to serve our current application and test the whole stack which seems like it will be a lot of testing at a higher level and we're bound to have gaps and potentially flimsy services. At this point it seems like the ""distributed monolith"" trap.

There has been a lot of debate too about how to organise this in jira. Some push for a ticket for the feature and then each layer is a subtask. This makes sense that the parent ticket represents the user story for the functionality, but does cause some issues in measuring progress - say if the frontend is really simple but the backend is actually quite a lot of work, so it might get carried across sprints even though some components are done. Normally I'm fine with this as it's a deliverable in a sprint and if it's not delivered, so be it, but if one component is done that feels like it should be reflected in the sprint's delivery, even if the end-to-end feature isn't finished (i.e. the service has a set of requirements of its own that is a deliverable, a consuming application can use this API to achieve something).

On the other hand, some want to have a ticket for each layer so we can track what's been developed and who by, but the requirements are always a bit thin on the ground, because it's essentially ""make the website do the thing"".

"Hello

I am developing an app using Flutter, but I have decided to create a separate REST API using SpringBoot that the Flutter app communicates with. 

User touches a button -&gt; app asks user's permission to access location data -&gt; app sends POST request with the latitude, longitude and id of the user -&gt; API somehow finds other users that are nearby -&gt; returns JSON DTO representing list of nearby users.

I was thinking of achieving this by having the API return a sorted list of Location objects with a userID, longitude and latitude property based on proximity. However, the only method to do this I can think of would be configuring the Location class to be an entity and saving it to the database every time it is updated, meaning that other user's locations will be available to the API via the database. However, this would perform poorly.

Maybe I could change the above so that when Flutter attempts to get the user's location, it also gets the location of all other users and sends them as a list in the POST request? But that would probably be even more unoptimized?

I have heard of caching before but I wonder if it could be used in this context so when users click the button it stores the location in some temporary data structure in the Flutter app, and then when a user clicks the button it only gets the current users location, adds it to this 'cache' and then sends the cache with the POST request?

"​​Hi all, I am not a very experienced developer but am working on delivering an application for a client that revolves around sending sms notifications to pharmacies. I am mainly looking for some insight and feedback on scalability implications and what could be some ways to address them or what to look out for.  Would like to plan ahead and get some feedback before I start coding this up.

I plan to build the frontend with React and the backend with Ruby on Rails with a Postgres DB. Looking to deploy the app on Heroku.

The app will facilitate communication between patients and pharmacies.  Goal is to have a public app that any patient has access to and submits a request for some medication. Then, every pharmacy that is enrolled in the app (admin will enroll them) will receive an sms that patient x needs y medication with z quantity.  The pharmacy will then either respond back to the request if they have the medication in stock or decide not to respond if medication is not in stock.

I will be using two main models:

\-&gt; Pharmacy model with phone number as a string attribute

\-&gt; request model with medication name, medication strength, and phoneNumber of patient making request. All string attributes.

I will be using the Twilio API to handle outbound and inbound sms.  Here is my plan:

1. When patient submits a request on the app (with their phone number included), make a request to my backend api endpoint and I will use Twilio API to send an sms to every pharmacy in my db.  At max enrollment, I could have **1000 pharmacies**.  Luckily, Twilio has some nice built in features for sending sms at this scale while circumventing api rate limits and carrier filtering.

2. If a pharmacy has the med in stock, they will be prompted to respond with the request number (plan to use the primary key here) that will be included with each sms.  Twilio uses a webhook url that I can configure to send to my backend.  My plan here was to make a query to find the request based on the request number (or primary id) sent back by the pharmacy.  Once I find the request, I can then send an sms to the phone number(patient) associated with the request.

I guess what I am not too experienced in is scalability and am not sure what to expect specifically on the second part of the process.  In the worst case, all 1000 pharmacies have the medication in stock (probably would never happen) and I will be getting 1000 messages sent to my backend within a short time frame, all while making a query for each message to my db to find the associated request and phone number of the patient.

Tech debt was never paid down as part of that transition.  10+ years later and we're not fighting our own codebase in order to man-handle and force (bad) code into the app.  The tech debit is so systemic (no clear boundaries, parts of the code know way too much about parts, no clearly defined interfaces, domain separation, etc. etc.) that to attempt to refactor in place is in my mind a non-starter.

"Hello all, I'm a designer currently looking into the UX of how various API tools onboards their developer users.

I notice that some API tools, e.g. Stripe, have a simple flow where you 1. sign up; and 2. get dropped into their dashboard with ""Get started!"" CTAs to docs, API keys, etc. Other tools, e.g. Algolia, have more hand-holding in their onboarding flows where you're taken through a step-by-step flow of building your first app.

I'm curious to hear from devs about your experiences onboarding API tools: do you have preferences between simple ""just let me read the docs"" onboarding vs. more handholding ""teach me how to set up an app"" onboarding vs. something else? Does it depend on factors such as your familiarity with the domain (e.g. you onboard Stripe as someone who's built payments before vs. never built payments before), or other factors?

Hello!

I'm making an game engine for my graphics programming course with the intent of having a better understanding of game engines work as well as using this for future projects to learn different areas that interest me. (Physics, Animations, Shader Graphs etc.). Building on top of this ""Engine"" as I learn new stuff.

Right now I'm at the part of handling the editors UI (Scene Hierarchy window, viewport etc.) for this I'm using ImGui and my engine is all C++.

I have been trying to think of solutions to render the UI in my editor. I have seen some code on github with a super UI class where which function is a UI element and it has a update function that renders all of them but that gets very messy quickly also terrible scalability.

I though of simple dividing my UI into classes and then render it, SceneHierchy, ViewPort class etc.

But my UI elements needs to often communicate with each other or even parts of the engine making the implementation a bit messy.

Those elements could derive from virtual class (Interface) and just have some virtual update/render method that I could call. But then I would lose a lot of functionality that I need from those UI elements and such.

"Hey reddit,  
maybe you can help, where I s(t)uck:  
**TL;DR:** I started coding 2001, since 2004 I did some bigger projects as freelancer (car manufacturer), went back to university 2012 to finish with a Master degree in 2017 - besides several jobs. Got some experience as full time employee, but it is not enough to get even a small promotion.   
What is required to be a senior or at least not a junior anymore?

**More details:**

However, since 2017 I never got offered anything better than a junior position. My grades are one of the best in my year, I even ""carried"" some fellow students - they barley passed but are working as software architects right now - triggering intensifies. 

Since 2017 I worked closely with seven (!) newbies in the team, who all got promoted meanwhile. I am not unsocial - people ask me to have lunch with me and we meet sometimes after work. I do most of the time, what is the best for the product and team (I have a strong opinion on code quality...).  

2018 and 2019 I lead two teams in a side project, which ended in a commission for several million Euros.

Asking for a promotion my superiors tell me, that I am not ready. They won't tell me, what is required, because: ""it's part of the process to figure it out"". It's not certificates... From Scrum master to Google PCA it was not enough.

So I thought: Okay, maybe it is my company, let's check other employers: I got several job interviews. It was never required to solve logic puzzles or to do whiteboard coding. But still: Junior is the best they could offer me. One company split the interviews: HR did one part, the other was done by possible future colleagues. They were also surprised that I was ""going"" for a junior position.

Meanwhile I went back to university again and started my PhD. Yesterday I saw on LinkedIn that one of my former fellow students starts at Google (barley got a bachelor, I helped him many days with his thesis and project).

Though it is not important at the moment (because research is my new love), it triggers me hard. Statistic tells me, I am just an idiot. My projects tell me the opposite.

"20 years ago, SWE doctrine said structure your solution correctly the first time, so it doesn't devolve into spaghetti.

More recently some people have advocated, code the simplest solution that will work for the immediate requirements on its behavior. If the requirements change and something deeper is needed, you can always refactor, this camp says.

A way to view ""correct"" with respect to the old doctrine, is to say that whatever computer ""science"" concept seems relevant to the category of problems into which your problem falls, reify.

For example, right now, I am looking at a little project to code for a process that will react to user actions by updating a display. The user gets to populate a data structure of parameters to the problem, using either interactive editing with widgets, or reloading arguments previously saved. The system always judges whether the arguments are valid for execution and when they are not, informs the user exactly why. Otherwise, execution happens and output from it is shown.

The ""code the simplest solution that will work"" approach would say to lay down editor code for the components, have it render to the screen the widgets for editing, accept and interpret the commands from the human operator, and also validate. So, concrete editing and validation, which are two separate concerns from a computer ""science"" or traditional SWE viewpoint, are intermingled in the same module for each aspect of the input parameters for a run.

The traditional teaching would say, no, no, no, you don't let those things mingle; that's spaghetti and it's going to tangle you up later. Write one whole module to **model** the data structure and validation constraints, and a separate module for the concrete realization of a particular editor with its widget appearance and the command language it accepts. The concrete editor would communicate with the data structure and validation model and say, OK, the user wants to set this field to a 3, and the model would say back, OK, I'm updating it, but it's invalid for execution because 2 is the maximum permitted value. The editor would relay this information to the user. A solution like this requires loading much more code, because it has to include the communication protocol between these two modules, a complication that is unnecessary if the validation concern and the concrete-editing concern are intermingled in a single module.

What that means is that if there is a bug or an outage with the system you support, you'll be working as long as you need to fix it. Even if that means you'll be spending your weekends and late nights. Missing family dinners and kids' practices.  


That's the status quo in software development. The assumption is that something will go wrong. There is technical debt, third-party libraries, third-party integrations. With so many moving pieces, a lot can go wrong. That's why every company needs to implement as many safety nets as it can. Unit testing, integration testing, automation, manual QA.

"I visited the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) yesterday, near Cape Canaveral, Florida. KSC is the primary launch center for many of the US space missions (think Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Space Shuttle). We watched several highlight-reels of long-past (retrofitting the Redstone rocket from a ballistic missile to a crewed space booster), and recently-past missions (Skylab and Space Shuttle). A consistent theme was the sheer number of people and resources that all of these missions consumed. Parallel to that, was the criticality of getting the engineering right, and the high-cost (human and financial) of failure. 

To me the construction of rockets, life-sustaining capsules, and the million other components necessary for space exploration are not completely different from building reliable software. In our day-to-day, we deal with defect escape rates so high that we would never rely on our software to support critical functions like space travel. 

How did the folks at NASA manage to control their bugs well enough to trust their systems through launch and, then, operation at hundreds of thousands of miles distant? 

Did they employ rigorous and very-high-quality architecture and engineering practices? What are some of those? Could we incorporate them into our software engineering construction process?

Was it maintaining detailed and up-to-date architectural documentation? Many of the control room video clips showed mission control engs poring over their Project Binders. 

They mentioned the thorough testing routines. Did they aim for 100% unit and integration (let's add e2e there, too) test coverage? 

My hunch is that there's a mother-load of important engineering techniques used in these enormous, critical, projects that are applicable to our low-risk, average projects. I suspect many of them have already been incorporated into what we consider the present art. But, I suspect even more deeply that we're still far from matching the discipline and low-defect rate acceptable for more established engineering fields. 

What can we learn from launching humans into space? 

(I know few of us in software engineering don't simultaneously double as rocket scientists, so I'm not expecting direct observations from that field. I'm hoping to stimulate a more general discussion on systems engineering and how we could apply more practices from the history of engineering into our software to improve reliability.)",SoftwareEngineering,2433,368

"Our single page application (SPA) aims to allow the user to save a bookmark to a specific point within our application.  The common screen lay out would first be an information category, which presents a grid of multiple rows of data on the left, then a set of tabs on the right, each with either forms and/or additional grids of rows.  The objective is to set a URL which represents the category, the selected row on the left, the selected tab, and the selected field and/or row on the right.

We have looked at the HTML5 History API implementation as mechanism for setting and navigation between UI components, by appending a hash (#) value after the base URI which contains the information to select the proper subcomponents.  The information would be element IDs with row IDs for grids, element IDs for tabs, and element IDs for form components.  We would have delimiters for parsing to facilitate the drill down.

A URL would look something like this... [https://ourSPA.com/app#stand,parts=7,screws,types=2,quantity](https://ourSPA.com/app#green,parts=7,screws,list=2,quantity)

Where ""stand"" is the category, ""parts"" is the ID of the left grid, ""7"" is the ID of the row selected in the left grid, ""screws"" is the ID of the active tab, ""types"" is the ID of the right grid contained in the screws tab, ""2"" is the ID of the row selected in the right grid, and ""quantity"" is the form field which has focus.

"Hi r/SoftwareEngineering!

I'm curious what your development database environment looks like?

I noticed [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/n6eged/do_you_prefer_shared_database_or_local_when/) in r/Database which revealed quite a few folks using shared development databases, whereas some clearly prefer their own local copies.

I wonder if this community has different opinions?

I must admit I was a bit surprised to see as many responses about using shared environments. I've heard from others (and experienced myself) that these shared instances can easily end up changing beneath your feet without you realising and causing all sorts of problems. Schema changes getting applied that conflict with your own, data disappearing or changing unexpectedly, etc. How prevalent are these in your day-to-day?

My other questions for those of you who do use a **local environment** is how is it set up?

* Is it running in a container via something like Docker?
* Is it your own instance in a cloud hosted environment?
* Have you installed the engine itself as a native service on your machine?
* Is it setup entirely differently?
* How large is it? Is it a copy of production? Generated test data?

"I have seen this problem in a couple of projects/companies I was part of:

First when you start the project you setup a staging and a production system and everything works fine. You develop your feature on your local machine, push it to staging, the product owner (or whoever) tests it on staging and if everything is fine, it is deployed to production.

If the team is getting bigger and bigger it happens more often that one developer deploys feature A on staging and developer wants to deploy feature B to staging. But she can not deploy it because it takes some time for feature A being tested/reviewed. 

So staging is occupied by one feature which suspends the development of another feature.

In our projects we than either build a second staging system called ""preview"" or ""demo"". Which solved the problem for a while, but if you grow more you will get the same problem. 

Or one time on of our developers tried to create a ""lab"" infrastructure where every branch would get its own running system. After 8 months of work the lab infrastructure still was not working like we wanted it (because often other things became more important and work on ""lab"" was postponed a lot) we gave up on the lab infrastructure. We killed it.

How do you manage this kind of development infrastructure? How do you give your developers the ability to have a running demo environment of her branch to do quality assurance or show to stakeholders?

How do you handle sending messages in your system (emails, sms’s, whatsapp, telegram, etc) to your clients? I already have the necessary apis integrated, I’m wondering how to build the system so it’s flexible and scalable.

Where would be a good place to store the templates? (we have most of them in .html and .txt files inside the ""server build"" and some in the database). Would an Aws s3 bucket be a better place?

And how to schedule messages after X time? For example, a patient has an appointment after 7 days and 3 hours. We are using Aws sqs queues but it doesn't work very well, and the only alternative I can think involves a database table and a cron job which might be even worse.

How to structure the code? For example, right now we have a cron called BirthdayJob that calls

`TouchpointGateway.sendBirthdayMessage(Patient patient)`

`EmailService.sendBirthday(patient);`

`SmsService.sendBirthday(patient);`

Usually, from what the professor has taught us, I believe that the client-server pattern is used in these kinds of systems(specifically ATMs)? However, we have studied broker system and for this particular system I was wondering that the broker system seemed to be more accurate?

From what I thought, there are three different kinds of servers that the bank needs: fingerprint authentication, pin code authentication, and banking database information retrieval and update. The remaining requirements could be handled locally at the ATM itself. The pin code authentication and bank database servers would already be in place. All that is needed to be introduced is the fingerprint server and the broker. The broker would direct requests from the ATM machine to the appropriate server.

"Hey,

Sorry in advance if this post is all over the place.I'll break it into points, so I can explain it as clearly as possible.

# My background

I've been programming for 13 years, out of which 3 were commercial (employment, contracts) - the rest were on and off freelance or opensource work.I'm currently employed as a mid-tier software engineer specializing in .NET, Vue, and GraphQL - but **I was also told I'll be promoted to senior engineer** by the end of the year, as soon as I gain more insight into the products we're building.

# The issue

Now, here's the issue - **because I'll be a senior engineer,** I'll be more hands-on when it comes to architecture. In fact, it was made clear to me that a few of the projects will be started and led by me, **so knowledge about proper design patterns and architecture could be a great benefit.**

Because of all that, I've started reading up on DDD, CQRS, Microservices, CAP Theorem, and all the related.. - and while **I understand the premise, I can't apply them to my projects.**

I've had no issue building microservices in the past and I realize they require at least basic knowledge of DDD and CQRS to successfully define bounding contexts and implement communication between services - but I've always done it by intuition (it just felt ""right"").

.. but now, when I'm trying to work on my own relatively simple microservices project and try to apply DDD on the service level (having proper layers: Application, Infrastructure, Domain) - I just get into **the infinite loop** and get to a point where I have a folder structure, get irritated and then start remaking it over and over again - it also doesn't help that I have **OCPD**.

I don't know if it's the right place to ask, but I would greatly benefit from a mentor that I could ask now and then whether my structure or implementation is well within the definition of DDD and/or CQRS.

"Let's say in your frontend user interface, the user interacts with an object (json object) and you need that object to always be in sync with the backend object (stored in the DB)

A straighforward answer would be that whenever the user does a change to that object you have to call your API backend to save it.

But then:

How do you handle the case when saving the object fails? When that happens, the UI and backend are no longer in sync since the change already happened in the UI but not committed to the database.

How do you handle the case where the save doesn't just store the object as it is coming from the frontend but needs to do some modifications to it? When that happens, the changes made in the backend are not in sync with what the user sees in the frontend.

Considered solution:

Have the backend return the object as it is in the database when the save succeeds or fails so that the UI can use that value to revert back the UI state in case of failure or update the UI in case of success.

But this just does sound very clean to me, in case of failure returning the full object doesnt sound like good practice in addition to having to return message errors. And in case of success it feels overkill to have to rerender the whole UI using the updated object whenever a change is made.

"Hey everyone,

Imagine this: a team where you don’t have to hold anybody’s hand. A team that delivers results with you only minimally getting involved in the frontline work.

It's not a dream.

Weeks ago we had an exciting chat with Mike Seavers (ex-CTO at Riot Games) about building self-managed teams. He shared all the tips and tricks you need to know. He’s working hard to implement the lessons he’s learned over the years.  


**Here are some key takeaways from the interview:**

1. What does the manager do in a self-managing team?

The leader’s job is to coach. You don’t do the frontline work anymore, so you shouldn’t make all the frontline decisions. Your job is to teach your direct reports to solve problems and think for themselves.

2. There are reasons not to build an autonomous team

Leaders often have a desire to get to the frontline and do the work. Making decisions for your team is often quicker than having them take time to consider those decisions carefully. However, you come out ahead in the long run by letting these go.

3. Communicate your expectations

Let your reports know that you expect them to think for themselves. You can turn it into a company-wide initiative or you can work individually with certain people. Just be straightforward, and give them space to actually do it.

4. Coach your reports instead of deciding for them

When your reports are making a decision, let them know you expect them to come to you with a suggestion. Help them think it through by reminding them of the goals and pointing out potential flaws. They’ll pick up on the process quickly.

Is it legit to inject **CreateCustomerHandler** to **SignUpCustomerByGoogleAuthHandler** as a dependency? Are there any pitfalls?

Read that it's not recommended to reuse your UseCases, but what to do in that simple case? Extract the whole **CreateCustomerHandler** as **Application Service** and inject it both to the **CreateCustomerHandler** and **SignUpCustomerByGoogleAuthHandler** UseCases?

"I'm refactoring some async code which throws exceptions instead of returning a promise. Right now this is bad because the code that catches the error then continues with its own legitimate logic. That is, the exception is used for flow control and not as an exceptional circumstance.

I want to refactor this to 1) not use errors as flow control and 2) use promises instead. 

I've seen Promise.reject in JavaScript and wanted to know what the consensus on using this is. Is reject considered an error state in a promise, or just a general ""the promise could not be fulfilled""? I don't want to rewrite it using flow control but just with promises, so my other solution would just be to return null or something which is explicitly checked.",SoftwareEngineering,739,129
"Hi, I recently asked a [question](https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/nh6jt5/doing_f_mvc_projects_on_ubuntu/) in a different community, about creating mvc projects, using f#.

&amp;#x200B;

One user, adviced me that this would not be a good idea, and that functional languages did not lend themselves very well to using mvc.

Most of my former experience with functional programming has been courses at uni, where we had to small braintwisting exercises. But i have'nt ever built anything before using functional programming, which is why i'm now trying do a website.

My previous experience with doing backend websites, have almost exclusively been mvc, so my initial thought was that I would just have a mvc project, built on mvc.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this bad idea? Should functional languages really be used in project with spefically functional patterns are used? or can I perhaps do i mvc f# project no problem?",SoftwareEngineering,919,139
" 

While studying design patterns, I found the following questions in a textbook, and I am having a hard time figuring out the answers.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Re-use an existing class but provide new functionality.**

I believe this could be the Decorator pattern: you can wrap the existing class in another one that provides new functionality.

**2. Be able to replace the implementation of an interface at runtime.**

Here, the ""run-time"" requirement is really giving me a headache. I think this could be the Strategy Design pattern, because it allows for a client to ask the Context which strategy implementation to use. However, the ""run-time replacement"" feels a bit of a stretch here.

**3. Extend the functionality of objects dynamically during runtime.**

Again, the ""runtime"" requirement feels problematic to me. I could argue that the Decorator extends the functionality of objects, and if you have written all the Decorators you need you can pick one of them at run-time.

**4. Decouple clients of a system X from dependencies on subsystems of X.**

This feels like the Bridge pattern, where you split a class into loosely coupled classes.",SoftwareEngineering,1147,185

"I've recently changed jobs and currently set up a team of developers to in house solutions previously provided by a couple of freelancers. The current setup was pretty much this:

After the initial fact-finding period, I'm pretty clear that both have done their jobs well, but that we are missing:   


* the data transformation and loading you would expect between what are effectively staging tables (full of months worth of data)  
* A middleware to act as a Data Access Layer for the frontend, which instead runs raw queries against SQL.

"Hello,  
I'm working on a macroservices (sane microservices as people call it) project and I'm having difficulty wrapping my head around an issue related to DDD.  


In a typical DDD project, you would have 3 layers: Application Layer (AL), Domain Layer (DL), and Infrastructure Layer (IL).

According to major sources on DDD - by default, the dependencies should look like this:  


[Dependencies in DDD](https://preview.redd.it/ml34ox2j4iz61.png?width=303&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=219460dfad8c1b8745befafcd3d01919a6325e86)

This makes sense:  
\- AL is usually an API that gets data or spins logic in DL  
\- IL is storage for POCO's contained in DL  
\- DL is just plain business logic.  
Now, the issues I'm having are - I'm using .NET, GraphQL, and Entity Framework Core (EFCore) for this project.

GraphQL allows sorting, filtering, and pagination of records, among with being able to fetch nested (related) entities with ease - provided it's connected to a queryable source, like `IQueryable&lt;TEntity&gt;`.  
This generates the #1 issue I have because it enforces that methods in my DL return `IQueryable&lt;TEntity&gt;` as opposed to my POCO's which aren't queryable.  
So, the dependency chart immediately looks like this:

https://preview.redd.it/cloy4l8y9iz61.png?width=603&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6218f47badca3f24cc5cb2365132134b6e2e80f

EFCore allows putting together multiple queries into a single query - thus reducing simultaneous database calls to one and improving performance greatly.  
This generates the #2 issue I have because it enforces that in order to make use of that feature - I have to write the logic in my methods around EFCore's `DbSet&lt;TEntity&gt;` instead of my POCO's.  
So, in this case, the dependency chart would change to this:  


https://preview.redd.it/hx4o9tmuaiz61.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bb880a145e7ce55357ce14a42afe084585a8c21

In both cases, the shape of DL and its logic has to adhere to AL or IL - which I consider anti-DDD.  
Any ideas? - perhaps I'm trying to apply DDD where it shouldn't be used?",SoftwareEngineering,2100,285
" ""It will create a huge mess. What were they thinking?""

The instructions were specific. Copy this column into a new column. If we need a join, then use the new column. Allow the original one to be edited. Reason? Well, because the customer wants it shown in their language.

Trouble was, the original was a primary key. Used for joins all over the code base. Database, services, backend logic, config files... We were looking at enormous maintenance and testing impact.

Whoever had come up with this solution, obviously did not understand this.

Here's the trouble with prescribing a solution like a spec. It's like a one-way hash. It encrypts the customer's needs into software features. But features will not tell you WHY they need it.

Did they really need exactly THIS column to be editable? We pushed back and digged deeper. Turns out no. They just want the frontend to show it in a different language. They did not care which column we use.

When you understand both the customer's needs AND the code base, you'll often end up with slightly different features. And a vastly more efficient implementation.

Inexperienced developers will follow the ""letter of the law"", and make (usually wrong) assumptions about customer needs. And they won't realize the long-term consequences until it's too late.

Experienced engineers will push back with ""why do it THIS way?"". Or, ""this will cause problem X, Y and Z"". They're not being negative. They're doing their job.

In the end, the smarter solution was simply to abstract the DISPLAY of this column into one central piece of code. This logic would then check a second column to see if there was an edit. If yes, display that, otherwise use the original. Primary key left untouched.

HUGE cost saving.

"Hi all, I am a software engineer and I have been working for this big company for 3 years. Last year I changed team and my current manager is very incompetent. I have tried talking to him but it seems that every month he comes with some awful idea that, in my opinion, has the only consequence of breaking teamworking. 

The point of my question is not much about those decisions but about the idea of complaining with his boss. I want to understand how bad this idea is as I can't see how things can go well for me.

Adding a bit of context, my manager is not doing anything illegal or unethical but he is feeding a team culture based on blaming games that can only break thrust within the team and pushing people to leave the team(half of which has joined last year, so turnover is quite huge). My boss's boss works out of the team and I am afraid he is not aware of shit happening. Unfortunately I don't know him, only met a couple of time, seems smart but no idea how he would react.

My idea is to go to my boss's boss and politely inform him about the situation within the team, asking if he is aware about these decisions and what he thinks about them. The obvious situation I am worried about is him agreeing with his decisions, going to reveal my complain plan and breaking my already not great relation with my manager.

"Hey guys, first reddit post here from me. I just want to say if you read all this and take your time to respond, I really appreciate it and any feedback you may have for me. 

I need some guidance on what to do with my career. I graduated from McMaster University (Hamilton, Canada) in April 2022 with a B.Sc in Mathematics and Computer Science (it’s not a double degree, it’s just half math and half computer science courses), I have applied to around 400 jobs since then and have given maybe like 4 interviews throughout this whole time, none of them being successful past the first round. I am currently considering three different options, the first is doing a master’s in Software engineering, the second is doing a 3 to 4 month coding bootcamp, the third is completely changing career paths. 

If I was to do a masters, that would be around 2 more years before I can get a software engineering job, and it’s not like I would be able to “use” the fact that I am currently doing a master’s to my advantage on my resume, as employers don't care if you are currently pursuing a master’s, they want to see if you actually have the masters. Another problem with this route is that a master’s in comp sci / software engineering isn’t really that beneficial as say other fields. For example, typically to get a data science or Machine Learning related job you would need a master’s or PhD, so it would make sense there and it would actually be worth your time and money, but not so much as here in the software engineering field. 

The second option of doing a coding bootcamp doesn't seem so bad, but they are relatively expensive (15k cad on average). For a 3 month program you’re paying 5k per month, which is most people's salary for the month, that's more expensive than university in Canada (my total university program cost was around 40k over 4 years). Another problem is that if I start the bootcamp and I get a job offer, what now? I may have paid a couple thousand dollars into the bootcamp already but now I have finally gotten a job offer, so that couple thousand dollars will essentially be a waste if I were to accept the job offer. Something else relating to the bootcamp is that let’s be honest, nowadays you can learn anything online, and build your own portfolio just through udemy courses. Yes I know that staying consistent without anything there to hold you to account (like the money I would be paying for the coding bootcamp) is extremely difficult, and although 99 % of people think they can do that, only 1% actually can. Two other nitpicks I have with the coding bootcamp is that I am located in Toronto Canada, where jobs are nowhere near as much as they are in the U.S. In the U.S there's a job for everyone, and that includes software engineering jobs - as long as you even have just a degree, some company out there will hire you soley based on that (I know as a Canadian citizen I can apply to jobs in the U.S, but U.S employers really only consider exceptional Canadian candidates since they need to sponsor the individual etc). Also for me to be in debt of my university tuition plus the coding bootcamp tuition and to land a small 65k CAD (49k USD) software engineering job, is it really worth it? I have bills to pay etc, it’s not like I can just pay that debt off in a couple of months with my salary. One last thing about the coding bootcamp(s) is that they are full stack focused, I want to be more on the back end side of things, because I like solving those DS &amp; A  problems (although I am not very good at them, I can barely do the easy ones - but I am keeping at it). And companies usually look for front end only, or back end only engineers when it comes to juniors, full stack engineers are more of a senior position. Fullstack at the junior level is like being a jack of all trades master of none type of thing (maybe I’m wrong though). 

The last option of switching careers, this is honestly only out of desperation if I do end up doing it, but regardless I want a career (whether it is in software or anything else) that allows me to climb up and grow, both in my knowledge and my monetary compensation. I was thinking of something like a sales job, since there are opportunities to grow in that field. But with my computer science degree will they really hire me? I believe they won't, I would need at least a year of customer service experience working in something like Walmart, which in that case wouldn’t it be better just do the bootcamp and if I were to do the master’s degree, I would only have a year left to complete it.

I can tell you as software developer who has experience. I do not like agile. If the tech lead is not motivating his developers. I’m afraid his going set me up for failure.

"The subject of coroutines includes, when we want or need to speak in precise, clear and unambiguous terms, a concept of a static artifact of programming, contrasted with a concept of the dynamic runtime structure that embodies the state and carries out or supports the execution. These are analogous to procedures and procedure activations. I asked ChatGPT what terms to use to distinguish these concepts and after some back-and-forth, I settled on ""coroutine"" for the dynamic manifestation and ""coroutine function"" for the static artifact. Are those definitions consistent with your understanding?

Also, comparing ""coroutine"" to terms that are semantically close, like ""coöperating thread"", ""lightweight thread"", looking in W'pedia and consulting ChatGPT, I feel that none of the other terms wants to eat up ""coroutine"" on the grounds of greater familiarity with the other term by software engineers without loss of the precise semantics. Do you agree? Choice of terms can be fraught as it guides the naming of libraries and entry points therein. A wrong choice is hard to undo and can interfere with readability. The coroutine concept I'm thinking of includes these features:

- for purposes of understanding access to shared memory, interrupts are in effect always disabled. A coroutine has to give up control, of its own volition, in order for the scheduler to get control or any other coroutine or the main thread to get control. In some programming languages, this yielding of control can be written as `yield`. In the Apollo Guidance Computer, a special entry point had to be called.

- code designed to be run in a coroutine can be run under a scheduler chosen or coded by the application programmer; this can be specialized e. g. to support priorities or not, support the possibility to cancel (abort) a running coroutine or not, and for testing whether code meets requirements concerning blocking or order of execution and concerning effects that ""eventually"" happen. A fake scheduler used for testing can be run to completion and the effects checked for.

- I forget if there were any other important features to mention.",SoftwareEngineering,2133,346

"Hello,

do you (or other people in your team) actually go through a (system) design phase before you start writing code?

All of the companies I've worked for skip the design phase part altogether - can you please tell me how you do it in practice?

Do you create diagrams first, using something like C4 or UML?

Do you also create skeleton code (i.e., signatures for functions and methods) for each module / component?

How do you make sure the devs follow the designs? 

Do you add the diagrams to the repo?

Do you set up the repo so that devs can't modify the skeleton code (i.e., name and parameters for methods / functions) but only add code to the body of those methods / functions?

"So I'm looking at Archimate, PlantUML, Structurizr, Enterprise Architect, UML in general, visual scripting, etc. and all they can do is draw what you describe to them. And then there's a handful of code analysis tools that show you dependencies and things based on the code you actually have already written. But I want to do my design and documentation, management, test coverage, all that in the same tool. (And this is also along the same track as the person who asked about the state of software project management. There's so many processes and pieces of software to help out here and there but with the amount of manual stitching between them, it all falls apart) With all the tools we use to automate stuff, I feel like there ought to be something out there that both auto-gens code from diagrams, and can read your code to create diagrams. You could use it to diagram out your code, flesh it out, and then when you've got it at the high level, move into your IDE to fitness, but then continue to have the same diagrams be regenerated for automatic documentation.   
I've been searching for years for something like this, but as a mostly aerospace engineer who happens to make software for such applications, I'm not enmeshed enough in cutting edge software engineering to know if such a thing exists, or if there's a very good reason why it doesn't.

"I've worked at software companies big and small for about a decade and the one common theme I see is they all can do a better job organizing information about the software they build and maintain.

Things like architecture diagrams (high/low level diagrams, UML diagrams etc.), UI flowcharts, documentation, metrics etc. are all scattered across various tools that all do that one thing very well. E.g. metrics are in Splunk, documents are probably in Confluence/G-Docs etc.

But it's hard to know how they all tie together unless you have it ""hardcoded"" in your head. E.g. you must know which dashboard in Splunk surfaces the metrics you're looking for, you must also know which document/runbook in Confluence has the relevant information on how to act on those metrics. And more often than not this documented information, if it exists at all, has drifted from reality i.e. the resources they point to don't exist anymore.

Worse yet, the need for this ""hardcoded"" information is precisely what makes onboarding new hires hard; it's my least favorite part of joining a new team.

At one of my previous employers, we created a ""team page"" on the internal wiki that aggregated the team members' directory links, listed the services we owned, included some basic documentation and embedded metrics via iFrames. But even that didn't meet our needs fully.

I've been laid off three times. I've left companies that were about to lay me off or go under eight times. I've been fired three times. Been on Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs) three times. I've walked out in protest a few times. Like the last one.

"So I (30y/o male) have been on the journey of learning to code for about 46 days. Wanting to find a better paying career path and a interest in computers/technology led me to start with Cs50. I did a lot of research on learning to code(procrastinating for 6 months while googling ways to learn to code and watching YouTube videos) and in the process stumbled across Harvard’s CS50 and something about a free course from Harvard got me going. After completing week4, I started freeCodeCamp a few days ago. I plan to finish cs50 &amp; freeCodeCamp, then see how I’ve come along as a programmer.

" 

Over the past three to four years, our organization has been working to enhance our Agile practices. While this journey has had its ups and downs, it has given us value to be more iterative.

First, I would like to provide some context to better understand the situation. I am part of the IT software development leadership team, and my software engineering teams are all organized into scrum teams, consisting of a Product Owner, Analysts, Scrum Master, Developers, and Quality Assurance specialists. Our sprint cycles are two weeks long. Engineers work on a feature branch and deploy it to a DEV environment where it is tested with other features. The engineers then promote the changes to our QA environment where the QA testers will perform their testing.

One of the recurring challenges brought to my attention is that during the two-week sprint, the developers consume most of the sprint on feature development, leaving limited time towards the end of the sprint for the Quality Assurance team to conduct their testing. I decided to sit in on a grooming session with one of the teams that have these challenges and one of the things I observed was that the PO was grooming tickets with a large number of acceptance criteria (8 - 12 bullet points of criteria for the ticket to be marked as complete). I asked the PO if she could refine that ticket into smaller workable user stories so the developers could deliver smaller features over to QA as soon as they complete the user story's feature.

I have engaged in discussions with several IT stakeholders and the following are some of the outcomes of those discussions. I would be grateful for feedback from others who have selected any of the potential options listed below for their own use and how it has worked out for their scrum teams.

\*\*\* **Option 1 \*\*\***

Implement a Shift-Left Approach for the Quality Assurance (QA) Team. This approach would involve the QA engineer starting the testing process early in the software development cycle, potentially testing in the feature branch or the development environment. As a result, the QA team would not have to wait until the code is promoted to the QA environment. Additionally, the QA team would be working closely with the developers from the outset, potentially assisting in the creation of automated unit tests for the feature.

\*\*\* **Option 2 \*\*\***

Instead of shifting left with option 1, ensure the team is refining the user stories small enough so the developers can work on smaller features (ones that might take only a 1 to 2 days) and quickly promoting those features into the QA environment for QA to begin testing as early as day 3.

\*\*\* **Option 3 \*\*\***

Option 1 &amp; 2 - Refine User Stories and Implement a Shift-Left Approach for the Quality Assurance (QA) Team. The objective of this combined approach is to break down user stories into smaller, manageable features that can be completed within 1 to 2 days by the developers. At the same time, the QA team would start testing the features early in the software development cycle, either directly from the developer's feature branch or in the development environment, rather than waiting for the code to be promoted to the QA environment.

**In Summary**

The only concern with shifting left for us is that I understand that to shift left, you need to practice automated testing as much as possible, and implementing TDD would also be helpful. Otherwise, your QA is going to be spending a lot of time manually validating in several places (feature branch, DEV environment, and the QA environment).",SoftwareEngineering,3596,609
"I have a few questions about the viability of my login/registration flow.  
Login/Registration flow UI:

1. The user enters their phone number, they are sent a verification code through Twilio.
2. The user enters the verification code and assuming the verification code is correct, the user is either navigated to the home page, or a different page to provide their name and email if they are a new user.
3. If they are a new user, they enter their name and email and then are navigated to the home page.

Login/Registration flow backend:

1. A **non-authorized** endpoint that accepts a phone number as a parameter, requests a verification code text be sent to that number.
2. A **non-authorized** endpoint that accepts a phone number and verification code as a parameter, confirms that the verification code is valid,  and checks if the phone number exists in the Users table. If the phone number exists, then return a JWT (with the user\_id as a claim), and a boolean that says the user is not new. If the phone number does not exist, then Insert the User into the table, and return a JWT (with the new user\_id as a claim), and a boolean that says the user is new.
3. An **authorized** endpoint that accepts no parameters (uses JWT), to update the Users table with the user's name and email.  


Questions:

1. Would it be bad practice to use the INSERT in my Users table as a way to determine if the user is new or not instead of doing a separate SELECT query to check if the phone number exists in my Users table (phone number is a unique constraint)? I imagine I could just catch the duplicate key error that is thrown on the INSERT, instead of doing two separate queries to the DB.
2. Should my endpoint that requests a verification code to a phone number be authorized in some way? I could imagine some outside caller potentially spamming that endpoint to send verification codes to random numbers.
3. If I use a JWT, I shouldn't ever need to pass the User ID as a request parameter right? Or is it bad practice to use the JWT to carry the User ID around?

Hello Reddit Community,

Are you someone who has always been fascinated by the world of software engineering and is looking to start a career in the field, but feels held back by the idea of needing a traditional university degree? Well, I have some great news for you! The world of technology is rapidly evolving, and with it, the way we approach education and career development.

In today's society, we have numerous resources and opportunities to learn and grow our skills, regardless of whether we hold a traditional university degree or not. With the rise of online learning platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and Codecademy, anyone with the drive and determination can learn the skills needed to become a software engineer.

That being said, it's important to note that becoming a software engineer is not an easy feat. It takes time, effort, and a willingness to continuously learn and adapt. But, with hard work and dedication, you can gain the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in this dynamic field.

So, the real question is, do companies hire software engineers without a degree? The answer is yes! While a traditional university degree may be a preferred requirement for some companies, many are open to hiring individuals who have gained their skills through self-study, online courses, or bootcamps. Companies are becoming more focused on the skills and abilities of potential hires rather than just their education background.

In conclusion, while a traditional university degree may give you a solid foundation in software engineering, it's not the only way to start a career in the field. So, if you're ready to dive into the world of software engineering, don't let a lack of a degree hold you back. Take advantage of the numerous resources available to you and start learning today!

"I'm working on a small hobby project and I want to implement proper / rigorous tests. 

I think I understand unit tests. I write unit tests for each function, or for a couple functions at a time if the functions are really tiny (for e.g. modifying a date format and then outputting it somewhere etc.). 

End to end testing seems like I would be testing user flows? (""Log in, navigate to this page, create an entry, go back to the home screen and check for the update""). Is that even correct??

BUT INTEGRATION TESTING??? How the heck do I know what to test? There seem to be dozens of instances where two modules might interact. For example, I might have my API routes defined, call the business logic, which calls on the database layer. Do I check API layer &amp; Service layer, Service layer \* DB layer, DB layer &amp; actual db instance separately (four tests)? What if the API layer uses two different services? Or is it enough to have a one integration test per API route?

Even unit testing a service layer function might call on the database layer. Is this a separate integration test? 

Also I have been storing unit tests next to the referenced code. Where do folks even place integration tests? In a tests directory with its own structure? (Some feature test directory -&gt; multiple test files that involve that feature ?)

I feel like folks with enough experience in the industry might pick up on how far to test / what it feasible / reasonable etc. just by working on large (and hopefully well maintained) code bases. And I'm hoping I can pick your brains because I am really struggling with defining what exactly I should be testing in an integration test.

Cover Letter: [https://imgur.com/a/gFBnzOI](https://imgur.com/a/gFBnzOI)

I've been in my current position for almost 8 months now and it is agonizingly terrible for software development. My title may say ""software developer"", but at 8 months in I've only JUST began writing code, and I could barely call that ""professional experience"". It's evident to me from the work of my tenured colleagues that this company has no future in software development, and I will be stuck working with some of the worst software on this planet (FactoryTalk, RSLogix, the likes) for the remainder of my time here if I don't leave.

I fear for my chances of getting a job in the future and don't want to stay somewhere that is going backwards, so I believe the best time to leave is now.

I've been applying steadily over the last 8 months to no avail, only 1 interview out of over 100+ applications. Granted I did very well in that interview and was, by their remark, in the top 5 out of 800 other applicants. Each application I send comprises of my resume and a catered cover letter filling in the above link with some personalized statements. But the fact remains that I'm getting nowhere and feel like I'm stuck in a rut. I just want out.

Please rail into my resume and cover letter, don't hold back. I want fully honest, critical judgements and detailed advice because I want to actually start my career and earn some real experience in my field.

"Based on the feedback that I got from the community [on the topic of preserving history](https://www.reddit.com/r/SoftwareEngineering/comments/10v5mea/how_to_model_document_history_in_relational/) I'm looking into and learning about event sourcing. 

So far, my plans are to implement a fully relational database backed event sourcing system, without CQRS. In this implementation, I would have an events table with event types and body, and my primary projection would be the read-only data structure that preserves the application state.

This is how I roughly envision this system:

[sql based event sourcing](https://preview.redd.it/yqirxns9f6ha1.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=020bec6406af88f89c239b74424a282472e2593e)

Because the system is not expected to ever exceed 10/req/s I wouldn't introduce any async actions or eventual consistency, but rather do every event update inside of a single transaction. 

For example, this is how a typical controller would function;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;def create(params) do  
&gt;  
&gt;   res = transaction do  
&gt;  
&gt;event = create\_and\_save\_event(params)  
update\_projection(event)  
&gt;  
&gt;end  
     
   if res == :success do  
return http.201  
   else  
return res\_to\_http\_code(res)  
   end  
&gt;  
&gt;end

&amp;#x200B;

What I already anticipate is that uniqueness validation could be tricky, as well as looking up the history of a particular entity (ex. give me all changes for milestone ID=xyz) without storing its ID somewhere on the event.

I am a 2+ years software engineer, and I recently went through a software engineering interview and was unfortunately rejected after the 3rd round. The first two interviews went smoothly, but it was the third one that proved to be the challenge.

Two days later, I received this feedback: ""*The team felt that your experience was much more software engineering led rather than aligned with the product focused ways of working that \*insert company name\* adopt.*""

* Do they have policies to restrict the choice of technologies they rely on? For example use only portable, open-source technologies instead of proprietary ones (e.g. Rabbit instead of Azure Service Bus) ?
* What's the impact on the solution architecture? Are you monolithic or fully containerized, using k8s as a runtime environment?

"So for starters, I’m in a situation where I’m a tech lead of a software group. What we have to work off of at the point are system requirements, that is very high-level requirements meant to apply to software, hardware, safety, security, test, and other groups working on this project. It’s our responsibility to write software requirements, design documents, and ultimately implement the software for this system.

I think the way we’re doing this currently is wrong, but I’ve been overruled by one of the senior engineers on my team (that in itself is a complicated situation, but not the point of this post). Basically, what we ended up deciding to do was this:

High level design of the software comes first. This is where people draw boxes with arrows and say generally how certain things will interact in software. We’re doing this before requirements because (quote) “how can you write requirements for software if you don’t even know how it’s going to be designed?” This is done only by senior engineers.

After that, requirements are written. This is where we delve into exactly what particular software units need to input and output, as well as what information each data structure needs to contain. This is also the responsibility of senior engineers only. 

After that, we do low-level design. This consists of writing each function out with its parameters and returns, then writing pseudocode for that function. This is finally where the whole team contributes. 

Finally, we implement the low-level design exactly. Until we reach this point, no one has touched a real compiler. 

We’re doing this iteratively in sprints, so all of that happens for small pieces of software in cycles.

The thing is, this seems wrong to me. What I think is this:

Software requirements should precede design, even high-level design. Requirements should be conveying what the software needs to do regardless of how it’s designed.

High-level design should bound the implementation, just as requirements should bound the design. Design should be our attempt at saying, “if we make software like this, all requirements will be met”. 

Low-level design as we do it should not exist. It’s no better than writing code on paper. The code documentation should cover this instead, and developers should be working with real compilers and tests by this point in order to create an implementation that works in the real world rather than in their own heads.

That’s the crux of it. What I want to ask is: Am I off base? If the way we’re doing it now really is better, then I’d appreciate an explanation as to why I’ve got it wrong. If not, then how do I explain/justify that what I’m proposing is a better way to go forward?",SoftwareEngineering,2710,459

I’m obviously stressed as I did not anticipate selling to IT/software professionals to be such a challenge.

"Hello folks,

I'll skip my personal life as much as possible but some details are important to assess the situation.

I dropped out of Uni having given only one exam in years (C programming), and my next focus was taking the Software Eng classes after a buddy of mine taught me what it was about.

I figured that it was the perfect place to start (in the meantime that I'd get the basic Unity certification to learn C# and the program) since I am a perfectionist (which is actually a bad trait) and I tend to have more of a ""planning"" approach than a ""let's do it"" one.

I've read the introduction of ""Software Engineering: Principles and Practice"" by Hans van Vliet along with some more chapters, but I was wondering if there were more ""practical"" books to read to be prepared to face such a big project.

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to have laid out almost all the work before starting to code, as I know that a big architectural change during progress is a big hassle to manage. Given my horrible temper, I know I will take big pauses in between so I'll surely forget the outline of the project, so a well written documentation is necessary to keep myself on track.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not trying to become a Software Engineer. I'm too dumb for that. What I am trying to do, is to use this discipline's basics to build a solid foundation of my future software. I began studying UML but I believe it's not enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I overcomplicating everything? Can you recommend a manual or guide for my needs? Thank you!",SoftwareEngineering,1521,276

Any insight is much appreciated, thanks!",SoftwareEngineering,385,69
"I feel like an idiot.

At work I was tasked with writing a launcher for a bunch of independent linux processes that we are developing. We wanted to support launching them, cleaning up system files that they left hanging around (for various reasons they couldnt clean up after themselves), and searching and modifying config files enmasse. It's a developer convenience thing that would end up on every dev's machine.

We also wanted to support both WSL and remote Linux boxes from a single client. Ultimately I settled on a TCP solution: An agent would run on the remote board, and the launcher would connect to it in a client/server configuration. 

We wanted the launcher to be extensible, so I wrote an XML schema and a parser that allowed us to add new apps to the launcher without changing any code.


The launcher would parse the XML, generate start/stop controls for each app, and then send commands to the agent running on the remote machine who would in turn start and stop them, as well as return status messages about the processes and clean up after them as they start up and shut down.

The problem? The commands were unencrypted plain-text including the locations of binaries on the remote machine, and exact config parameters to run them with. The TCP server would run whatever the connected peer told it to, in whatever folder was passed.

I created a TCP server that could run arbitrary commands received as plaintext on a remote machine, with no login required. All a hacker would need to do is open a wireshark instance, sniff the packets, and then they'd know everything they needed to know to make the target box do essentially whatever they wanted. We were going to configure it as a linux service on our virtual machines, dev boxes, and wsl instances


I spent DAYS writing this before I realized what I did. Luckily I caught myself before it was pushed to the repo and other developers actually started using the dang thing. Maybe it would have been caught in the PR, maybe it wouldnt have, but every WSL instance on every developer's machine could have had the worst possible kind of back door installed on them.


I don't know how I didnt catch this earlier. Neither did anyone else that I showed it to and discussed my design with. Like, I'm happy I caught it, but how did I not see it for what it was before I dang near finished the thing? 

The worst part is that I have cybersecurity training. 

Ugh.

I guess sometimes you don't see the forest for the trees.

I could implement SSL and encrypt it, but even encrypted I hate the idea of an ""Arbitrary Bash Command"" service running on any of our machines, encrypted or not, so I'll probably give up the remote agent component altogether and use an ssh-based solution.",SoftwareEngineering,2745,485

For example, I understand that O(1) is likely going to fall under math equations and hard-defined methods that don't rely on external factors for processing (Data, API, etc).  Most data calls would fall under O(N), O(N\^2) and so on.

When you have a database, how would you identify that a method may fall under O(N\^2) (or greater) and how would you approach optimizing it? Is it even realistic to aim for O(1) or was my initial estimate of what falls under that category correct?

Hopefully that was clear; I've been struggling with understanding Big O for years and I'm trying to buckle down and finally understand it to use it in a practical sense.",SoftwareEngineering,760,134
"Optimization, problem fixing, removing unused functionality, and improving already existent functions are all parts of continuing software maintenance. Tech teams can use the elaborate framework given by IEEE repeatedly with their own unique activities and procedures. The major stages of the software maintenance life cycle are described by this framework as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Problem identification phase: Phase one of the problem-solving process involves identifying the software modification requests and giving each one a unique identification number.
2. Problem analysis stage: This stage evaluates each legitimate modification request to ascertain its viability and scope.
3. Design phase: Based on needs provided in earlier phases, developers construct new modules that need to be replaced or modified at this stage.
4. Implementation phase: During the implementation phase, developers adjust the software as a whole and add specifications, new features, and code.
5. System test phase: During this stage, the development/testing team tests how well new modules work with the overall system.
6. Acceptance test phase: During acceptance testing, internal users or a third party specify and run tests on the fully integrated system.
7. Delivery phase: The group distributes updated software to users following a positive outcome from the acceptance testing.

"Since ChatGPT, many articles have been popping up about how AI will replace software engineers and developers. (Maybe not in the near future, but eventually)

1) Reasoning, if AI will be able outperform humans in software development, building amazing application useful for other engineering courses like CAD softwares, then what stops it from replacing other engineers like mechanical, aerospace, etc?

As far as I know if we reach a point that AI is able to automate software engineers, then won’t it as well automate all other engineers? I mean if the AI is smart enough to automate the development of complex applications, then it will also be able to automate the usage of those applications. Maybe it won’t even require to develop those applications and just bridge to output the required engine/design artefacts. It will be able to assemble complex physical process pipelines.

2) What I don’t understand is why will software engineers/computer scientists be replaced before other engineers. Aren’t they necessary to maintain and enhance AI? If we reach an AI able to learn entirely alone this means no other job is safe.

I can’t quite understand why software engineers/computer scientists are the most in danger of losing their jobs. I though computer scientists would be the last jobs to become obsolete if AI excels humans, since they are the brains behind AI advancements.

3) How aren’t careers like lawyers, accountants, physicians, etc more in danger? Those careers can be highly automated as well. Aren’t computer scientists needed to automate them?

4) Also will software engineering/computer science change towards a more AI and interdisciplinary point of view? Or will it remain the same and just become obsolete in the future?

I'm currently looking for a full-time developer job as a fresh graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

My Background

* Fresh graduate with a business degree
* Internship experience (software engineer)

Familiar Programming languages

* Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, React and Swift.

Strengths

* Fluency in most of the common data structures and algorithms
* Ability to write clean code and apply design patterns
* Desire to learn new things
* Able to communicate with precise technical terms

Weaknesses

* Lack of presentable projects
* Unfamiliar with software development practices

My mentor's feedbacks on my internship

* Lot of myths about software development - it's not just about coding and writing algorithms.
* Lack of a developer's mindset *(What is a developer's mindset like?)*
* Slow feedback loop - sometimes I tried to solve a problem my own for a long time without updating on what difficulties I was having
* In software engineering, systems thinking matters more than mathematical thinking. *(What does systems thinking mean for a developer?)*

"Here is my situation, 

I am 24 and looking at transitioning to the CS Field. My undergraduate degree is in English Literature and I’m thrilled to have had the experience to learn it. Covid shifted plans now I searched for alternatives. I’ve been self learning CS while working full time at a startup tech company as a CSM where I learned that I do have a deeper curiosity for the product. Should I go back to school, i have enough grant money left over to pay for my second bachelors. However, having missed out on many classes to obtain a CS degree, I’d need 96/124 credits which would equate to 5 years or so of school while maintaining a part time job (according to my academic advisor). 

Bootcamps are something I’m familiar with having also completed one for UX, and while it didn’t land me a roll as a designer it did help me land my user centric roll at the moment. 

My concern is would a bootcamp allow me to have experience and knowledge to enroll at an MS level course? 

My question is should: 

-go back to get a second bachelors in CS, and complete the degree in 4-5 years (I’d be 28-29) 

-get a bootcamp certificate and then get a MS in computer science since work experience could test me out of some pre requisite classes

"The evolution of computing environments has led to the growth of more efficient and flexible systems. Starting with single servers, the demand for better resource utilization led to the introduction of virtualization. 

Virtualization allowed multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical server, each isolated from the others and with its own operating system. This greatly improved resource utilization and made it easier to deploy and manage applications.  

However, virtualization has its own limitations, such as increased overhead and complexity. This led to the development of containerization, where applications are packaged into containers that run on a shared operating system. Containers provide even greater efficiency, consistency, and portability compared to virtualization.

So I was watching a youtube video that was talking about Interfaces, now in the video he used a the example of a fitness website. Where the base class was a User, then he had different child classes that would extend the User class (like a Employee, Manager, Customer, etc...), then he made an object of each of those classes in the main method, passing the arguments for the custom constructor and was showing the methods that where available in each object that came from the base class. The question that popped in my head was ""If this java code is backend, and it connects to, lets say a JS front end, and lets also assume that there is code that talks to each end via api or whatever may be. What input could a client (who is using the Fitness website) possibly put to make the back end create a object in the main method?"" Like it seems like he was doing all this OOP stuff, to be able to create an object in the main method that reflects a real user with all its real properties, but my question is if a user was to sign up to the fitness site, of course there isn't a programmer in real time going into the main method creating an object and passing that clients parameters in the custom constructor, so how does the instructor in the video showing that he can create a object with arguments and that that object has certain objects available correlate to a real situation where a user is interacting with the fitness site.",SoftwareEngineering,1726,325

But, when using IOS applications, for example, the users need to update the app in order to see differences and get the latest changes to the code..  
Why is that? what is the difference?  
Thanks",SoftwareEngineering,502,89

"Hey all! I'm a student studying Software Engineering and for one of my classes our group project is thinking of making a Playlist Generation Feature that is based off of user input and prompt.

I'll post a quick description here (same brief we have used for our project):

**“SpeedList”** is a Spotify tool that can generate playlists based on prompts from the user. For example, a user could input the requested playlist type as ""80s Country Music"" and the feature will create a playlist with songs of the specified genre(s).

The idea for this post is to get some feedback on specific (or non-specific) traits for this feature to use as base requirements for us to program with. We are also required to crowd-source some requirements, so this is helping us with that as well. Some example requirements look like this:

* Users must be able to search keywords from available tags (genres, artists, time periods, etc.) which SpeedList will then analyze and generate a playlist according to user input, which then can then save to their Spotify library.
* Users should be able to give a specified number of songs or an approximate time length that the playlist must reflect.
* A playlist generation must take under 10 seconds.
* The SpeedList web application must be responsive such that the SpeedList page(s) loads in under 2 seconds.
* A minimum 50% of songs in the generated playlist must not be contained in a user's 'Liked' songs to promote the uniqueness of SpeedList's generation engine.

Your feedback can be as unique as you like and will be helpful to us regardless of your perspective and how you use Spotify (artist, listener, playlist curator, etc.). You can even let us know what you think if you don't use Spotify, maybe you use something like YouTube or Apple Music. Thanks for your insights!!

"My company is insisting that I use a CRM tool (Similar to salesforce) to build a system for our latest client. 

The system needs to collect data from the users and generate recommendations based on the contents of it. Think of it like this. A system that suggests movies based on your preferences. And also they can add a list of movies into the database if they wanted to. 

&amp;#x200B;

As of now, I'm telling them we can build our on system from scratch. But, they want it to be quick, so they are planning to purchase some CRM tool. As far as I know, CRMs are meant to be used for in-house and not an application that is open to the public. They argued that building something from scratch will take a longer time as I am developing it alone (Full-stack). 

&amp;#x200B;

So right now, I'm trying to learn my way around the CRM and trying to make sense about all of it. I'm just not seeing how I'm going to build the system using the CRM in the long run. Do note that I need to add custom functions as well to fulfill the requirements from the stakeholders. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thus, my question is, should I continue with the CRM and struggle my way in to create something that they want, or should I convince them that we can build it from scratch and implement whatever function that we want.

"Companies have embraced the concept of test automation in agile as it not only accelerated their testing process but, also led to frequent customer feedback. This in turn led to enhanced product development, thereby churning out a high-quality software product. Products are released within shorter timelines. Agile development can simply carry out its activities at a faster pace than expected through the incorporation of automation testing. Test automation also plays a crucial role in the DevOps platform. A large portion of the development pipeline can be automated. Initially, a single end-to-end scenario is automated and then run the test on a scheduled basis. In this article, you will get to know how flexibility can be maximized by implementing Agile and DevOps.

**What is test automation?**

It is a software testing practice wherein a software product such as a web application is automatically reviewed and validated. This is done to make sure that the predefined quality standards for user experience, functionality (business logic) and code style are met.

Test automation tools play a key role in carrying out automation testing activities efficiently. As many organizations are adopting agile and DevOps lifecycle, it becomes important to utilize test automation across the lifecycle to unlock the key benefits of DevOps and agile.   

**The strategic role of test automation in agile:**

Faster product release requires accelerated testing, which, in turn, requires accelerated coding. Whenever a new update to the application is released in the market, every user using that specific application expects the app to be perfectly functional. If the users are not happy then there are chances that they might switch to a competitor, which in turn may impact the brand image of the organization.  

Flawless functioning is ensured by testing each update and feature comprehensively. Such complex and feature-rich software will take a lot of time and effort to perform manually and hence automation testing is considered to be a feasible option.

Test cases are created by QAs through automation testing in agile approach. Whenever a new code is pushed to the code repository for a specific application then these test cases will run automatically. This specific practice is called as continuous testing in agile and ensures that the new code is free of bugs before it hits the production environment.

Several tools and frameworks such as Cypress, selenium etc. are used for implementing test automation in agile.  

**The strategic role of test automation in DevOps:**

Testing becomes a shared responsibility of the entire team through the DevOps platform. Developers can ship code changes quickly through the automation testing platform. Unit tests are written by developers to validate the code works as expected. 

Automated UI tests are created by product owners and quality practitioners through which the end-to-end user experience is validated. Exploratory testing sessions are organized by quality practitioners where the various application areas for issues are examined by the team manually.

Running automated tests as often and as early as possible within the CI/CD pipeline is considered to be a DevOps best practice. Automated UI tests in production are run so that user experience issues are proactively monitored. Synthetic transaction monitoring is performed by applications that rely on numerous services. Tests are run in production so that issues can be detected with third-party services before your users do.",SoftwareEngineering,3549,548

So i have been thinking quite a bit about these lay offs recently and wanted to share this .  
Are the lay offs mostly just a result of the end of the pandemic?  
Since the begining of the pandemic, the scope of work has been increased by a lot as every small business needed some online presence.  
During these times, everyone was employing Software engineers as much as anyhow possible, so since peolpe are less home, using those services less and small businesses do not need them to operate, could the lay offs just be going back to the state before covid?

"Can anyone advice me what to expect or do in my situation?

I'm a fresh grad having only a 3 months experience in a non-tech company as an intern and I had finally gotten my dream job at a product based company I've been trying to get into after graduation for so many times but my team lead gave me a warning/slash foreshadowed that I might not be here after the probation.

My probation was of 3 months. During which, first month was pretty much used up in getting me to learn Angular (I had no Angular background), the product itself, the codebase, their coding practices and such. The second month, probably in the late December, I was given my first task split into 3 tickets. All had similar work or the solution was similar in all 3 of them. So I got to work, I admit, since it is remote work so I was kinda little slow since the nature of the task was easy and I knew I could do it. So I completed the tasks before the sprint ended, actually a few days before the sprint ended and I submitted my tickets for PR.

The problem began with the constant issues rising in the PR during my team lead's feedbacks. I kept implementing those changes (mostly coding practices related and stuff). The team lead even had a peer coding session with me to show me proper coding practices of TypeScript and I learned a lot during that and thanked him for it. The issues kept rising in the 3 tickets to the point that only 1 PR got approved at the end of the sprint while the rest of the 2 kept getting reviewed in the next sprint. I was also assigned more tickets but couldn't work on those as the API wasn't available from the backend team.

I also kinda fucked up cuz I misunderstood a team lead's message and merged a branch of one of the tickets without approval. That ticket also had a syntax error that I didn't see so I worked with a guy from I'm guessing he was from QA or something, to fix this issue and roll back the changes which were thankfully only on the preview stage and nothing was harmed. But it was very humiliating for me (I didn't know approval of PRs was strictly followed and it is my mistake for forgetting that even though it was written in the coding practices document shared with me)

During the probation, I had a few communication issues with my team for which I took complete responsibility and apologized and promised to be better and I did. Got more active and responsive on Slack and etc. Now a few days ago, I requested a 1 : 1 with my team lead asking for help in clearing a blocker since the culture really emphasizes on the fact that everyone should help clear each other's blockers. That's where my team lead said something to me that is still worrying me to right now ;-;

After clearing the blocker. He said that he's not satisfied with my productivity and the quality of my work, and I'm also lacking on communication side. That I was given more than enough time to learn Angular but still I'm getting stuck on trivial problems. That even the blocker today was something covered in my course (it wasn't, I confirm this) and that I shouldn't have been stuck on it. And that, since its my probation, its very risky time for me and that once the probation ends, my manager would ask for his review and he would give his review being loyal to the company. He said that even tho I'm a fresh grad, I should really step up my game and that its a golden opportunity for me to be in this company as they don't hire fresh grads and only experienced engineers (which is true and the company is OG). That I should really step up my game and all since my probation is nearing its end and all that.

Thank goodness the camera wasn't turned on during the meeting cuz I was literally crying while saying ""okay.. okay.. yes.. my apologies.. you're right"" and he was like ""I'm not comparing you with the other hire we have (he's also a fresh grad but had a year experience in another company so he's way ahead of me in terms of productivity and coding)"" and all that. I am forgetting a few other details of what he said.

After that, I completed my PR feedbacks in the next day and completed the ticket and merged it. I am trying my best right now to be as productive as I can, as soon as I got the API set up, working with the backend guy, I made sure I could complete as much work on my end as possible on Friday before the weekend. 

But I am still worried that I have left a bad impression on my team lead and that I should kiss my job goodbye and all.. I have a meeting with my manager tomorrow.. I am scared on what to expect.",SoftwareEngineering,4549,867

I am extremely infuriated by the wrong information that’s coming out about these tech layoffs. People are insulting tech jobs, the companies, and employees who are still employed at the companies.

Secondly - there seems to be a lot of misinformation about _which_ roles got laid off exactly.

Everyone knows big tech hit a hiring surge &amp; hired an insane amount of employees. Meta was in the need about hiring over 100k new employees as were many faang companies. These layoffs seem to be roughly the same % hired during that time.

But I have always been tech savvy and wouldn't minding getting into something along the lines of software engineering or coding, are those terms interchangeable?

"I'm not sure if this is the best subreddit to discuss this, but I'm looking for advice on how to design my application.

I'm creating an application wherein a user inputs String and Password. Password will encrypt String and store that cyphertext in my database. I will not store Password.

In order to recover String, the user must input some identifier for String and Password again to decrypt the cyphertext.

**My problem:** Regardless of whether Password is correct or not, my application will always output something(Of course, the only time output is meaningful is if Password is correct).

**My solution:** Along with storing String, I will store a hash of Password in every entry. When retrieving, my application will output if and only if the new Password's hash matches the hash stored in my database.

The structure of every entry in my data would subsequently be structured as follows:

id || Secondary Index || Cypher of String || Hash of Password

"Hey, I recently sat together with Michael Lynch, an ex-Googler and ex-Microsoftie who now runs his own tech start-up, Tiny Pilot.   


I asked him about software engineering practices at Google and Microsoft and how they differ from what he now does at his own start-up. We are both code review fans, so we also talked about this engineering practice.  


In a nutshell, he stressed that at Google and Microsoft, you write code that has to be supported for many, many years. In a start-up, you might not even know if the code will ever have customers. So, quality concerns are totally different.    


He also said that in a start-up, as a technical founder, you do not have to convince anybody to pay back technical debt. It's at your own discretion. So moving fast at the beginning is not such a problem.  


Still, at his own start-up, he does code reviews, also to mentor his contractors and to ensure the code is maintainable and consistent. And he also writes tests.   


But he does all of that always with an eye on the return on investment, which we should also do in other settings.

So, if it's too hard to write that unit test, he writes an integration test. And if he sees manual testing is sufficient at the moment, he does not write tests.

"Hello everyone, 

First sorry if my english is not that good - not natively speaking. 

Just wanted to have a feedback on my career path, maybe this will resonate to some of you. 

I've been working for 10 years mainly around project management and managed to reach the status of tool and infrastructure manager for a tech company. I'm managing a devops engineer team who also  delivers and supports a wide range of tools for our collaborators. 

I've been using my technical skills as software engineer (I have a graduation in computer science) to facilitate the collaboration betweens teams, to sensibilize top execs to technical stakes in order to win sponsorship or negociate budget. In parallel, i'm always trying to keep updated on new technological trends as this is mandatory in our domain. 

The thing is, since my graduation, I haven't had the occasion to put my technical knoweldge in practice. In other words, I haven't put my hands in the ""dirt"" by programming. I've kept this ""high level"" vision and only worked on making my team to converge on the objective to deliver my projects. Never got involved in the micro tasks by programming. 

I feel that I've skiped a huge step in my career and feel the need to go back to real technical stuff. I miss developping. I do code in my spare time btw (mainly game development). 

I now start to feel the impostor syndrom when I discuss with senior engineer even though I understand them and manage to get aligned on our objectives. I'm afraid that this lack of technical experience puts me in a position where i'm not relevant anymore.

The issue is it's very hard to come up with a dataset to test the entire flow of the system and as we are having more business requirement it seems impossible to keep up if we were to do it manually.

I am currently considering which dev path to take to specialize in and become a valuable swe in the future. Here's how I see it (please let me know if my assumptions are wrong): 

\- **Backend development**: This field seems to offer high-paying jobs with a higher barrier to entry. Specialization in this area is a good choice as all companies will need backend engineers especially in infra/security. 

\- **Full-Stack development**: This path doesn't seem like it would be as specialized as backend, since you would be working on both frontend and backend. However, it would make me a more versatile programmer. 

\- **iOS development**: Only need Swift, Objective-C and SwiftUI for iOS dev, can easily specialize in, smaller pool of iOS devs since you can only use macOS to develop iOS apps. The thing that is stopping me from picking iOS is the possibility that iOS could become irrelevant in 10+ years possibly with VR or some other tech.

"As a learning exercise, I want to implement simple calendar with *recurring events*.

I'm struggling to find some papers, articles or examples what is best way to do it. So far I identified following approaches:

1. Create `abstractRecurringEvent` that is not shown on calendar. Some background job reads all `abstractRecurringEvents` and creates `normalEvents` based on `abstractRecurringEvent` for next X years.

Pros:
Relatively easy to implement.

Cons:
Background job being error prone (must keep everything perfectly in sync).
When `abstractRecurruingEvent` is deleted or modified, it has to update or modify all `normalEvents` that originated from the `abstractRecurringEvent` (this might update or delete hundreds of records).

2. Each ""day"" when renders itself checks all ""abstractRecurringEvents"" if the ""day"" matches `abstractRecurringEvents` recurrence rule. If yes, then adds an event.

Pros:
Doesn't require background process that creates events for next X years 

Cons:
In case of many `abstractRecurringEvents`, each new day might be tested against dozens of it, thus potentially slow.

"I am currently a mechanical engineer in an R&amp;D Prototyping role. Over the last few years I have developed increasingly bad back pain to the point where I am now considering permanent disability. I am not able to sit at a desk, stand, or work over a table for more than an hour without taking long rest breaks laying on my back, but when I am laying down I can work on a laptop with my head propped up. I am also a veteran and have access to the VA vocational rehabilitation program and I am considering making a proposal to retrain in cs. If I can do 100% remote work I think I would be able to be productive in a programming role.

Does this sound like an achievable goal? Are there opportunities out there that would be accommodating in this way, especially in a junior role?

Other pertinent information:

My back pain is not acute, but it builds up slowly over time. I can force myself to sit, stand or do other work for much longer periods but I will pay for it in pain as it builds up. This is unsustainable for my family as I come home in a lot of pain and a very bad mood after working a full day, and of course my ability to concentrate on my task diminishes as the pain increases. This means I could still occasionally grit and bear it for in person meetings or interviewing, but is not something I can do on a daily basis.

I don't have a ton of software experience so far but I did take a lower division course in C++ (that I did so well in the professor asked if I would tutor/ta for the next semester), and I had an upper level engineering dynamics course that was extremely heavy in Matlab programming for the lab portion. I also have math courses through to differential equations and linear algebra (but no discrete math).

I have a good enough GPA to apply to grad school and may be able to get a masters degree paid for by vocational rehabilitation, or alternatively I could also do a boot camp. I don't know enough about cs career fields yet to know what I would really enjoy working on but the type of problem solving and programming I have done would probably be more aligned with back end work. I think the career path might more be driven by what types of jobs would accommodate me, how saturated and needed those jobs are, and if there is a considerable difference in pay in some paths. 

I did go through the faq and wiki and found some great information in there on switching careers, but I figure the disability part of my situation makes this unique enough to write a new post. 

What would you do in my situation?

Long story short it's kinda too late to change majors without really pushing out my graduation timeline since I'm a Junior however I do have the opportunity to add a CS minor to my finance degree with only adding an extra semester or two max.

I took a few CS courses as electives for my Associate degree in Business and have always had an interest in coding and software but ended up just transferring to my 4-year uni as a business major.

The reason I mention that is I could essentially take classes at my community college online while doing my bachelor's and earn an associate degree in computer science without having to add the extra semester to my bachelor's program since I have already taken a few CS courses at community college.

My question is would it be better to have an Associate degree in cs or just get the minor? The minor is only recognized on the bachelor's transcript and I will not receive any certificate or diploma if I chose to go the minor route. Would an entire degree in cs (associates) be more marketable to employers than just having the minor or does the minor look better since its earned at a 4 year institution?

"TLDR; we have an [expert beginner](https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/) making life hell, what do we do about it? Should we do something about it.

## Quick Backstory

I went to a really cool, project-driven, eye-on-industry standards type of school. I did really well and I am comfortable with the knowledge and lack thereof.

I am in my first job at a small company as a junior software engineer.  We're an OEM so we're quite heavily software based.

## The problem

Another junior and I started working there at the same time as junior software developers. We were met with our manager: the right-hand person of the CEO/almost graduating electronic engineer/embedded programmer, self-taught 'software engineer'. This person has been working at the company for 5 years already.

My fellow junior and I started noticing some really rotten things about the code base and management. It's been months of after-work deliberating on why the company is so awful to work at, and we've even been making some progress in how we think we can help the company and fix its blatant problems.

## Holy Vindication

Last night I read this: [How Developers Stop Learning: Rise of the Expert Beginner](https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/). It is as if the heavens aligned just to bestow this golden article on me. Every word of this describes our team's predicament and the cause of our anguish.

## The point

My fellow junior and I are leaving the company soon (textbook [dead sea effect](https://medium.com/geekculture/the-dead-sea-effect-d71df13724f8)). But armed with the knowledge of why the company is doing so perpetually mediocre, I have a couple of options:

- Wait until I have my next job confirmed, ready to put in my leave, then casually just drop the article in their inbox, and wait for all hell to break loose, sticking it to the man.
- Casually just drop the article in their inbox, and wait for all hell to break loose, sticking it to the man.
- With this knowledge and a bit of advice from you guys, see if I can't help them a bit with this problem that is just going unnoticed.
- Maby pass the article on to the CEO in the hopes that they see that we have a problem, and that we are suffering under our management.

## Unnecessary Final Note

It's been a rough year in this company, and this article has just been such a perfectly sobering description of why. It would just be nice for once to say: ""See, I do know what I'm talking about. We should have unit tests. You're just an expert beginner that is absolutely suffocating this company with your ego, therefore you can't even have a rational conversation about how our code is actually bad.""

I tried asking this question in softwareengineering.stackexchange but it was closed for being ""opinion-based"". I hope I can find an answer here, or at least an explanation for why my question is opinionated or doesn't make sense. 

Many representations of the V-model, such as the one above, show three  steps of design: system design, architecture design, and module design.  The distinction between module and architecture design seems to be  pretty straightforward: Module design is concerned with individual  components whilst architecture design is concerned with how these  compontents fit together. However, the difference between system and  architecture design is one that I failed to grasp. When I tried  searching about the distinction on the web, most of the sources I found  were trying to explain the difference between design and architecture,  or software design and software architecture, but not system design and  system architecture. The wikipedia article about the V-model says that [Systems design](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_design) is the phase where system engineers analyze and understand the business of the proposed system, but I don't see  how can understanding or analyzing be considered ""design"".",SoftwareEngineering,1383,182
"In the requirements analysis stage of requirements engineering, you produce requirements models. Let them be for example domain models (UML class diagrams), use case models (UML use case diagrams) and business process models (BPMNs).

Later, in the detailed design stage, you transform requirements models into design models. For example, you transform domain models into component and interface models (UML component diagrams).

How do you satisfy the need for requirements traceability? Do you insert elements from requirements models into design models and add arrows, or do you create separate traceability diagrams?

How do you later maintain the diagrams?

For completeness, I'm using SparxSystems Enterprise Architect for the requirements and design modeling, if that changes something.",SoftwareEngineering,793,114

"Yesterday I installed  Windows95 on a virtual machine. Having IE3.0 not much works on the web  except google and my website :D, so communication in general seemed  problematic. So I gave Nightfox a chance, it's a peer to peer cli  program for text comm and file transfer inside a LAN or direct IP which  works on linux and windows. I wrote it in C  one or two years ago. The  windows version was compiled on a Windows 10, as a 32bit executable so i  figured I could try and run it on windows 95 :D.    
Guess what?! It worked!  
An  almost 30 year old OS ran communication software written for Windows  10. I'm not a windows fan, I actually hate everything windows spit out  from Windows 10 onwards, but I have to admit compiling a program on a  todays OS and have it run without any change or any major issues on Windows95 is quite impressive. Well.. I'm actually impressed by Windows 95, not the  modern OS anyway :)))

"I started reading *Managing Technical Debt: Reducing Friction in Software Development* by Krutchten, Nord, and Ozkaya. In the first chapter, I read the following sentence:

&gt;Data analysis organizations estimate that the global maintenance backlogs for information technology software amount to $1 trillion of technical debt.

Does anyone know how they came up with that $1 trillion number? Is there a public study where I can read how these ""data analysis organizations"" quantified and measured technical debt? It's not that I'm dubious (I am a little though) but I would like to see how researchers are quantifying tech debt in organizations.

"Hi there! Consider the following problem: there is a team A that needs to implement a method. This method is already implemented by a team B in another package X. Maybe you think that the most obvious solution is to import X into the project, so they reduce duplicated code in the projects codebase (don't repeat yourself!). But Team A is skeptical to do this because there is a trust problem in Team B: if the package X brakes in the future and the projects gets down because of it, it is possible that Team A gets penalized. In summary, Team A doesn't want to depend on the Team B's ability of avoiding future problems or solve a incoming one. The more time Team A gets blocked, more money is lost by the company and, since it's a Team A's project, they will be responsibilized. So, Team A is considering to just copy the method from X package and paste it into where it is needed.

" Fitness apps have become increasingly popular over the past few years, with people using them to monitor their health and fitness goals. However, not only are users making the most out of them, but businesses are also. Fitness apps offer a great opportunity for any business to get their products and services in front of potential customers that may need to  be reached via traditional marketing methods.    


 

Companies can use various features such as nutrition tracking and workout reminders to promote their products or services by creating an app dedicated to fitness and health topics.

"My buddy is a fresh college grad who majored in ""Cognitive Science"", which at my uni consists of a blend of courses in psychology, philosophy, and some basic computer science. He recently told me he got a job offer working as a ""Machine Learning Engineer"" at a large software company, and is making 280k all-in comp straight away out of college. I was initially super happy for him but I've started to develop a healthy amount of skepticism. 

For one, I looked up ""Machine Learning Engineer"" on LinkedIn and all the other employees at his company with that job have PhD's in computer science and decades of experience. Secondly, another friend of mine (comp sci major) got a job at Apple and says he's making well under that amount, and claims he doesn't know anyone in software (even at Google and Apple) making that much all-in comp straight away.

"Goal-setting. I hate it.

My Question: What are some personal or work goals that you have set for yourself that you look back on with pride?

More Background:  
I am a senior software engineer with fourteen years experience. I enjoy most of the aspects of software development, and am always willing and able to learn and become adept in the ever-changing landscape of tooling and practices adopted by my organization and/or the industry at large.

I have a hard time with setting goals. I am aware of the SMART or CLEAR frameworks, but my issue is less about how to measure an outcome, and more along the lines of: what can I plan to do this year that will result in my personal growth as an engineer, and also be valuable to the company?

Some ideas: use some unfamiliar programming language to build something, obtain a relevant certification for X cloud platform, regularly contribute to open source projects the company uses, read some books about a particular topic.

My problem is that for any given year, I only have a limited amount of time to devote to these activities. They are usually only tangentially related to the work that I get paid to do, so I want to choose goals that are in-line with that work, or that I would enjoy doing after-hours.

As I'm typing this out, I'm realizing that the real issue is that I don't have time during the work day set aside to pursue these goals, so I feel like I have to do them after-hours. If it's after-hours, I don't want to do more company work, I want to do something different and refreshing that I choose that's fun to work on.

Contributing to an open source project is probably my best bet, since I'll be exposed to a variety of people and processes, and I can choose what issues look interesting to work on.

So in the end, this was something of a rubber duck session, but I'm still interested in any constructive thoughts. Thanks for your time. :)",SoftwareEngineering,1910,345

"Hi, I am getting started on a small dotnet challenge, where I have decided to use the entity framework, which I am quite new to.

The general idea is that I have a database of customers that have bought cars, and I need to be able to filter this database, based on some constraints that the user has typed in, and then display it again.

I'll first list my models. Here is first my customer entity

    public class CustomerModel
    {
            public int Id{get;set; }
            [Required]
            public string Name {get;set; }
            [Required]
            public string Surname { get; set; }
            [Required]
            [Range(18,110)]
            public uint Age { get; set; }
            [Required]
            public AdressModel Adress { get; set; }
            [Required]
            public  DateTime Created { get; set; }
            [Required]
            public virtual List&lt;PurchaseModel&gt; purchases { get; set; }
    }

each customer has an adress which I'm not showing

Each customer can also make one or more purchases, a purchase has  it's own model which looks like  this:

    public class PurchaseModel
    {
        public int Id{get;set; }
        
        [Required]
        public int  CustomerId { get; set; }
        [Required]
        public virtual CarModel Car { get; set; }
        [Required]
        public DateTime OrderDate { get; set; }
        [Required]
        public float PricePaid { get; set; }
        [Required]
        public  SalesPersonModel SalesPerson { get; set; }
    }

There is also a car model for each purpose, which o'm also omitting.

Each purchase has been made with the help of a salesperson, which is modelled like this:

&amp;#x200B;

    public class SalesPersonModel
    {
        public int Id{get;set; }
        [Required]
        public string Name { get; set; }
        // would we really want coworkers to see each others salary?
        [Required]
        public Title JobTitle { get; set; }
        [Required]
        public virtual AdressModel Adress { get; set; }
        [Required]
        public uint Salary { get; set; }
    }
    

Now, I have a function which takes a QueryModel object which checks all the input fields, and then filter according to them

&amp;#x200B;

It looks like this:

            return customers;
        }

The first part is pretty straight forward, I just filter directly on my customer object since it has all the navigational properties needed on the customer object.

&amp;#x200B;

But, I also need to filter on the attributes of the salespeople that have sold cars to different customers, and then return the list of customers based on that.

Since I don't have a direct relation between a customer and the salespeople that that customer have used, I have the second block of where clauses, where I first filter all the purchases, based on the customers they have, and get the purchases that have used the specific salespeople.

After getting all the correct purchases, I get the correct customers by comparing with the purchases, and seeing if they relate to the customer.

&amp;#x200B;

The last part feels a bit clunky and it feels like I could be structuring the relations in a better way that could allow me to make more simple queries.

"# One of the most powerful ways to improve or maintain code quality is proper code reviews.

But many teams face challenges from outside of Engineering to protect the time to do code reviews well.

Here’s how we would explain to a non-technical colleague why code reviews are essential.

# First, you will lose engineers without a culture of mentorship and learning.

Engineers are among the most in-demand positions for all companies across the globe. COVID and Work From Home sped up the globalization of the talent market for engineers. As a result, companies need to invest in their Engineers aggressively. If you’re not actively building a great place to work, you’re on the losing end of the war for talent.

One of the ways to build a great place for engineers to work is to shape an environment that supports mentorship. Learning and exploring on the job is no longer a “perk” but a requirement. Engineers are deeply curious, and code reviews are a great way to facilitate a learning culture.

# Second, you will fast-track the effectiveness and productivity of new engineers.

If you hire new engineers or bring in third-party development shops and freelancers, you want to ramp them up as quickly as possible. Code reviews fast-track the onboarding process.

The difference between an effective and ineffective onboarding is six months or more of lost productivity. Unproductive onboarding means wasted financial resources and time, slower time to market, and ultimately, losing pace with your competitors.

# Third, engineering effectiveness and velocity will be lower without code reviews.

Your CEO will undoubtedly have heard the concept of “10X developers.” Whether or not that’s true is a discussion for another time.

Code reviews are a way to create 10X teams. It’s a great way – in my view, perhaps the best way – to continuously improve the quality of the entire team, not just an individual. This is because coding is fundamentally a craft, not a competition– a rigorous skilled activity that requires learning from more experienced experts and one that requires deep knowledge and concentration.   


The greater the investment in growth and learning, the higher the team's effectiveness will be.",SoftwareEngineering,2218,362

"An interdisciplinary team of researchers at the University of Glasgow is running a short survey seeking the views of software practitioners on how sustainability considerations influence their day-to-day practice.

The development of societies and economies that are sustainable is now an urgent priority, recognised by both individual governments and multi-national organisations. Many organisations are beginning to implement measures in response. However, sustainability can be understood in different ways by different stakeholders from different perspectives.

"I've started working on a large software engineering project lately and my experience so far has been this:

1. Try to find the project goals
2. Try to come up with ways on how to achieve those goals
3. Try to find a techstack that supports those ways
4. Go halfway into the implementation based on that techstack
5. Realize it doesn't work out the way you originally planned
6. Panic because this could mean that you might have to change a large part of the implementation or even techstack
7. Somehow come up with a way to make it work with the current techstack but it's a bit clunky
8. Wish there was someone you could ask on how to do it better but there probably is none
9. Repeat at step 1

"I read an article and forgot completely where it was from except that it was some sort of a blog. It asked what is the real value-carrying product of software engineering and claimed that it is not code itself but the mapping between it and the real-world problem: how different parts and aspects of the code correspond to different features of the problem.

I remember two phenomena that the author explained with this idea. The first is the inconsequentiality of Twitch's code leak. If the value of software engineering lies in code, then Twitch lost all of its value in the leak. Concretely, potential competitors would have everything they need to create similar companies and cut into Twitch's profits. The author claims this didn't happen because the mapping between the code and the problem, which is Twitch's real asset, lies in the engineers' minds. It was not made publicly available by the leak and therefore potential competitors don't have what they need in order to recreate the platform.

A second phenomenon I think I remember from the article is the urge to rewrite projects that are reassigned from someone else who is no longer available. If the code itself were the asset, rewriting would be nothing more than a waste of resources. But programmers often find themselves wishing to rewrite code that they received from someone else. This, claims the author, makes sense. Code (ideally) starts out as clean and simple but gets more complicated as the problem becomes more well understood. These complications match different aspects of the problem Again, the mapping between them and the problem exists in the original developers' heads. When new developers get the project without being able to communicate with the original ones, they are not familiar with the different aspects of the problem and therefore perceive the complexity as a liability. Starting from scratch enables them to recreate the natural flow from simple to complicated code coupled with the creation of a conceptual model matching the problem.

"Full Spring Boot authentication microservice with Domain-Driven Design approach and CQRS.

Domain Driven Design is like a art of writing a good code. Everything around the code e.g. database (maria, postgres, mongo), are just a tools that supports the code to work. Source code is a hart of the application and You should pay attention mostly to that.  DDD is one of the approaches to create beautiful source code.

**This is a list of the main goals of this repository:**

* Showing how you can implement a Domain-Drive design
* Showing how you can implement a CQRS
* Presentation of the full implementation of an application
   * This is not another proof of concept (PoC)
   * The goal is to present the implementation of an application that would be ready to run in production
* Showing the application of best practices and object-oriented programming principles

Your contribution:
* Give it a star
* Share it

**A brief overview of the architecture**

The used approach is DDD which consists of 3 main layers: **Domain**, **Application**, and **Infrastructure**. 

*Domain* \- Domain Model in Domain-Driven Design terms implements the business logic. Domain doesn't depend on Application nor Infrastructure.

*Application* \- the application which is responsible for request processing. It depends on Domain, but not on Infrastructure. Request processing is an implementation of CQRS read (**Query**) / write (**Command**). Lots of best practices here.

*Infrastructure* \- has all tool implementations (eg. HTTP (HTTP is just a tool), Database integrations, SpringBoot implementation (REST API, Dependency Injection,  etc.. ). Infrastructure depends on Application and Domain. Passing HTTP requests from SpringBoot rest controllers to the Application Layer is solved with “McAuthenticationModule”. In this way, all relations/dependencies between the Application Layer and Infrastructure layer are placed into only one class. And it is a good design with minimized relations between layers.

Tests: The type of tests are grouped in folders and it is also good practice and it is fully testable which means - minimized code smells. So the project has:

* integration tests
* unit test",SoftwareEngineering,2300,342
"Curious if anyone has experience writing polyglot APIs (multiple langs within the same endpoint, not different micro-services in different languages), or experiences with language interop? If so, are there any resources that helped you learn?

**Background:**

At my job, we tend to use c#, ts and python. Over the last couple of years I've had to implement apis in all 3 languages. It just has me wondering if writing api's from scratch across languages is bit of a waste. I.e. why don't we write all our web apis in just c#, and try to interop with other languages when we're trying to leverage some lang specific lib?

I can imagine that there might be some pitfalls to what I'm suggesting, such data transfer challenges and overhead, multithreading issues if either language involved in the interop is trying to do something multithreaded, tooling complications, etc. But it seems like a small team trying to implement APIs in 3 different languages is also not an ideal situation either, since it's hard to master the quirks of any backend framework. So I'm wondering if there's a ""right"" way to go about language interop?

I'd love to be able to write c# APIs, and have them communicate with python or ts libs as needed. So far suggestions I've seen involve spawning processes and calling scripts, communicating with a grpc server running on a socket in the same vm/serverless function. If anyone has lived experience doing these things, or suggestions about resources on this topic, I would greatly appreciate any advice 🙏",SoftwareEngineering,1528,257

"We are building software for a client that requires a variety of third party website providers to be able to create &amp; update records in our client's database. The gold standard has always been some sort of feed implementation which looks like this:

2. Ensure each feed has a unique reference
3. Create documentation for third party to build a feed to our specification
4. Get them to provide a URL to their feed (json, xml, or something like that)
5. Enter URL into our system and consume the feed to populate database

However, we've been toying with the idea of instead simply building a REST API, along with the appropriate documentation, which allows the third party to consume and ultimately POST &amp; UPDATE records in our database. There are limitations to this however, compared with the feed approach.

"I’m a software engineer at a top tech company. Recently, I was given a task that’s straight forward but requires following documentation to do it. The documentation is incredibly confusing and disorganized. It’s very unclear how you’re supposed to accomplish this task, the team responsible for it is in a different timezone and responds only once every 24-48 hours. I’m killing myself to finish the task. Every day I’m being ask to provide an update, I’m being told this needs to be done ASAP, needs to be done really fast, etc. 

Today my manager told me that this was taking way too long and they expected it to be finished by now, and that they were considering just having someone else do it and taking me off. He said “\[other engineer\] said it was really easy to do this.” Basically telling me that I’m incompetent or a bad engineer. When I asked \[other engineer\] if he could help me, he said the person who had done the same thing had left the company so he wasn’t able to help me. So turns out he didn’t even do it, he was just saying it was easy.

Since he asked to see, I walked my manager through what I was doing and I could see how confused he was getting by how the process/documentation works. 

I wanted more than anything to say “if it’s so easy, why don’t you do it?” But I’ve already done about 70% of the work and they would just take credit for it.

"Alright, so I've got a Java/SpringBoot web service I am building. This service contains an endpoint that is exclusively for updating existing data. It is very possible that multiple users may decide to update a single record at the same time. I would say the likelihood of this is relatively low, but it is possible.

My first thought was to check the lastUpdateTimestamp on the database record before saving the update. I record the current timestamp as soon as the update begins, and there's a bunch of pre-processing that happens before saving the update, so if this value is higher than the one I'm about to set it to, that means that another update beat this request to the database, and I reject this one.

So far so good. However, checking the lastUpdateTimestamp and then saving (or throwing an exception) is a textbook race condition. To solve this, I wrapped the whole thing in a synchronized block. Problem solved.

Except... it's not really solved. This application is going to be deployed on a cloud service provider where it will scale from anywhere between four and twelve instances, depending on the current load. Everything I've put into place to prevent this race condition only works at the single-instance level and doesn't prevent this kind of update operation across multiple records.

Anyway, I'm wondering if anyone knows of any solutions that can be put into place to prevent this kind of issue? It's all going to the same database, maybe that's where the protection has to live? Very open to advice on this, thanks.",SoftwareEngineering,1541,262
"Memeing is a double-edged sword. Apparently the recent vulnerability discovered with Apache log4j has become common knowledge with non-technical and technical people alike, which raised a few questions in my unit about whether or not we use it for logging.

"Everyone knows they need it. You can have test coverage software to make sure that you're not leaving components untested. Of course I'm making the assumption that the code base is coded to SOLID standards as is fully testable and you understand how unit-test frameworks operate in the sense of using things like mocking &amp; spying. My issue isn't with the technical side of it.

The real issue is how do specific suites of unit tests bring actual business value in the terms of:

* are we verifying all the correct possibility of variants &amp; invariants?
* Who is responsible and at what points in the project for identifying all the critical mass of assertions in a service/application?

The latter one is especially important because theoretically I could simply put Assert.IsTrue(true) in all my tests and they pass 100% but bring 0% business value. Of course in the real world, nobody ethical is doing that and competent code reviewers would catch that.

The real hard part is in reality to me it seems that nobody is really really reviewing the assertions to know if they're a) correct b) how many assertions did you miss? That's really hard work, everyone is super busy and things will fall through the cracks.

"I'm a decade into working as a software engineer and I can confidently say that one of the worst things I ever did was not choose a speciality and stick with it (mobile, frontend, backend, data engineer, data science etc). 

While it's ok to learn a lot of different things as a software engineer, you should not work at a place that exploits that learning by not having defined roles. I just left a job that developer after developer quit I ended up being a ""yes"" man. I took on several mobile, frontend and backend responsibilities which lead to major burnout from management requesting features and fixes in languages I haven't even touched in my career. I found that by doing that I ended up missing deadlines and taking a reputation hit when in reality those roles should have been filled from management requesting more hires. 

Rant over, but it's crucial for new software engineers to understand that you'll be rewarded more for being an expert in your field instead of a generalist that's always having to stay up late and learn new languages in very little time to push out features that you won't fully understand the tradeoffs of the languages you crash coursed.

Response: It’s going to be hard to go through every comment and have a discussion without getting blasted. Let me ask you this question: What would you do when this (below) happens?


Team members that leave:
- Lead developer 
- New lead developer 
- Site reliability engineer
- infrastructure engineer
- Senior software engineer
- Junior Software Engineer
- Mid-level software engineer
- Mid-level software engineer
- Project manager

Remaining team:
- Senior software engineer
- Software Engineer
- Software Engineer
- Software Engineer

So now you’ve got one senior and three mid-level software engineers doing the work of 9 people that have left.

This was my point when you start doing it all it’s time to leave. If you don’t you’re going to put yourself in a really bad place in your life as relationships are going to suffer, your mental health is going to suffer and your physical health is going to suffer of course that’s just the tip of the iceberg. 

Again go read up top again if you missed the point, it’s good to learn a lot of different things but when you start having to do it all you should leave because that shows it’s a management issue. Beware of managers commenting on this post telling you that you should stay, if you’d like to throw yourself under a bus for your team go for it but you’re going to suffer.

Also when I say you should “specialize” I’m talking about an “area” not a language that’s why I mentioned the areas above. When you specialize in an area that means you can be very effective and get stuff done which is all that really matters. You can’t avoid learning about a lot of other things but you should try to be T-shaped in your experiences. Go look at roadmap (https://roadmap.sh) website.",SoftwareEngineering,2922,513
"Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a Software Engineer / Architect at a privacy-oriented startup. Due to public regulations, we cannot use US-Software infrastructure/cloud providers in general and need to keep all data on our ""own"" servers (we are using a german infrastructure provider).

For that, we'll need to start building a catalogue  of integrations for external services to access/read/write data from third party systems \*of our customers\*. So we need to provide those integrations to our users so they can connect their systems. 

I stumbled across the term ""embedded iPaas"", which pushed me towards a make-vs-buy decision. Those offer exactly that - embedding such an integration catalogue and sometimes workflow builders for more complex logic. However, most of them are in the cloud/too complex/too stiff for our use case.

Therefore, we are currently evaluating licensing such a platform vs. building these API connectors ourselves.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have experience with building/using such a integration catalogue? If you already interacted with/built something like that, I'd be very interested in your opinion on the topic.

"Hey everyone. I work in the enterprise solutions space, and one of the big features of the software platform that my company provides is the ability to create multiple versions of different web applications. There is a complicated proprietary process that it uses to achieve this, but essentially the end result is that you can create multiple versions of an application that is served to different users based on certain criteria, like what their job is or where they are operating out of. These different versions are analogous to branches on a VCS system in that they all are based off of a master version, but the key difference is that they are never meant to be merged back to master. They exist as their own separate version that is maintained and can be provisioned for deployment.

I have been thinking a lot lately about how this is achieved, and I realized that I am not really sure what is common practice for this sort of thing.

I am not really interested in debating what approach is best, more about what approaches are out there.

* I started with the idea I would use Django REST as the backend, and after 3-4 months of using it, it become increasingly more complex for me to do things that were needed. So I ended up switching to .NET 6.0 as my backend which took another month or so to write out the barebones of the backend. 
* I originally had the bright idea of handling user authentication/authorization myself, however, after a couple of months I realized how difficult it would be to do that correctly and securely, which led to me switching over to firebase auth. Learning how that worked and modifying the API and my DB to account for that took another month or so. 
* After a couple of months of working with Axios on the front end, I was running into some difficulties and decided to switch over to fetch, which hasn't been a terribly long process, but just another set of things I needed to change. 

Finally what led me to make this post, I am currently making calls to firebase from the front end, and after having everything implemented I started to think it would be a better idea to make those firebase calls from my .NET backend instead. After realizing yet again this would be another huge refactor, I realized going about things the way I am is in no way productive. 

Ultimately, that leads me to my question, how can I organize myself and properly manage a project from start to finish and get out of the refactor hell I keep getting stuck in?",SoftwareEngineering,2080,387

"Hi all,

First post. Please be gentle.

I’m a Data Engineer. Data has a notoriously bad approach to development compared to the software space and I want to bring some of the good to the data space.

I’m struggling with branching strategies. We need a dev/stg/prd data warehouse, and we use dbt to build it. Dbt lets you write a combination of SQL and jinja and compiles at run time to build the tables and views in the data warehouse using a DAG to ensure the right things are built in the right order.

The current approach is to have main/stg/dev branches. We create a feature off dev, then back to dev, through stg and into main. The branch is directly linked to the relevant database. The code is compiled from the contents of the branch, and run against the warehouse (which updates the data in the warehouse using the appropriate logic). The impact of this is that if we get two user stories through to stg for two different teams, with one team able to test right away and the other not until next week, the first team has to wait for the second team to approve before anyone can get their stuff through to main. It’s a monolithic deployment.

We’ve been strongly steered away from cherry picking.

Is there any other way? Guidance would be greatly appreciated.",SoftwareEngineering,1269,229

From my perspective living in the US, I would mostly say no. It falls more into the “engineering” category to me than IT. Though, many IT departments at various companies will have software engineering teams within them doing their own thing. These dev teams create proprietary software catered directly to the IT company’s IT related needs. Then IT professionals will work to sell and deploy these new software solutions into the customer facing world. 

So IT to me is more about the deployment and maintenance of current technology systems within the working world. In other words, there is little designing of new technology in IT. Rather, the IT professional’s job is to know the current existing technologies in and out, and be able to deploy them wherever needed to meet the needs of customers.

"What I mean is that if I want to authenticate for Application A, my OAuth2 /token request must contain the Client ID &amp; Client Secret for Application A as the Basic Auth header of the request.

For the Authorization Code flow, this makes perfect sense. In Auth Code, Application A will delegate to the Authorization Server for the actual user login. Then, once it gets back the Authorization Code, it will send that request, and the Client ID and Secret **are its own id/secret.** I've got no questions related to Authorization Code, this flow makes perfect sense.

Client Credentials, now here I start to have questions. The purpose of Client Credentials, as I see it, is to allow Application B to talk to Application A. Based on what I've read in the OAuth2 specification, for Application B to get an access token for Application A, it will have to send a Client Credentials request with the Client ID/Secret for Application A as the Basic Auth header. This seems to compromise the critical security of Application A by forcing it to share its ID/Secret.

The same thing applies to the Password grant type. I know this one is heavily discouraged, I only ever use it for testing APIs, never for any actual production communication. However, in this case, the user trying to authenticate for access to Application A needs the Client ID/Secret of Application A, yet again compromising the security of those credentials.

I would think that the ideal implementation for those two grant types would be as follows:

Client Credentials, you would use the Client ID/Secret of Application B, plus the ID of Application A, and then the authorization server would grant a token if Application B has been configured to have access to Application A.

Password, you would only need the username/password credentials, plus the ID of Application A, and yet again the authorization server would grant a token if the user has been configured to have access to Application A.

If someone with a little more perspective on OAuth2 can explain this to me, that would be great. I'm misunderstanding something here, either the ideal way to use OAuth2 to work with these grant types, or some piece of how it's supposed to be configured. Thanks.",SoftwareEngineering,2224,378

Share your current employment methods/  frameworks / tools / processes for embedded secure software development, and any issues / challenges, or successes. If you could also share the industry and general size of the organization, for reference.

My previous roles have been pretty lacking in terms of secure practices.

Industry: Large Defense Contractor working on Government Project

Methodology: Agile

Secure Frameworks: None specified.

Tools: Automated static analysis tools in CI builds

Processes: On feature milestones, external penetration testers brought in to provide feedback on vulnerabilities


Issues: No training provided to developers. Security was not embedded. We had some horrendous security flaws when a prototype project, was 'sold' to the Government, and instead of being redesigned, it was 'enhanced.' 


Other Comments: Our senior development team thought about the security of the technology in use: We had secure communication methods prescribed, we had solid data encryption and backup processes, users required 2fa, only supported certain usbs, secure boot, custom hardware etc etc. The in-use security from 'the enemy' was considered, but the security of the software itself wasn't considered thoroughly.



In my current role:

Zero security consideration except for security updating the 3rd party software we use, and just the individual skill / knowledge of the developer - no training provided, or minimum standard expected. No security testing at all.

"Every single book I've ever read on software development says the same thing: Never over-engineer your system. This initially makes sense to me. The problem I have is that it seems as though software engineering is the only discipline in which flexibility and improvisation are skills that are considered appropriate. 

When we want to engineer a building, a plane, or a car, it makes sense that we'd want to have the entire system perfectly designed beforehand. Because of the consequences of bad design, this makes sense. When we look at software development, however, I constantly hear about the horror stories of terrible legacy code and of being able to adjust our structure on the fly. 

In what world is it okay for an aerospace engineer to just say ""Well, the engine and the battery are fused together but at least they work"" or a civil engineer to say ""F\*ck it, just add more pillars and cement""?

For the flexibility of development part: Is it really that hard to have a CLEAR idea of large systems before a single line of code is written?

"I work for a company that has a very mature code base (20+ years) that's essentially endless, undocumented spaghetti. Up until very recently, the development team was 4 people. The company got acquired along with three other international companies in the same industry and jammed under one roof.

The people who have been at the largest company for awhile really don't want anything to change--they'll disrupt meetings, ignore emails, play dumb, etc to avoid change. The problem is that none of the legacy code is compatible with framework versions published after 2011. They don't want the projects currently being written to touch, update, or use modern security while interfacing with their legacy code, so they're doing all this in service of making integration with anything older really hard. 

Many of my tasks concern writing anti corruption layers, to permit that integration. It's hard to integrate if you can't get any information on what needs to be integrated, if the older team keeps logging objections that require everything to stop and potentially be re-architected because there's suddenly a new use case/surprise requirement change/oh that isn't even the thing that was supposed to be integrated with/oops we forgot to tell you, etc. Because there's no documentation of the mature code base, the newer teams can't easily check on anything for themselves, and the code base is in such bad shape that it can take a month to try and figure out what a section of it is doing, which we're doing, but it's slow going.

The management is the same way: been there for decades and systematically under-provisioning or not helping with new projects. It can take months to get basic questions answered (if at all).

The investment company that bought on the new CTO and CEO have an agenda to create a bunch of new software, integrations, and to rewrite that code base, and in fact I was bought on for part of that. The management tells them that the projects doing new stuff are fully provisioned and everything is great, even when the project is stalled or critically behind.

I have a ton of this documented and have sent that documentation by request to the new system architect, but in the mean time all my projects have stalled and the management is making all sorts of weird, gaslight-y claims (like they were never informed of things that were the subject of meetings they are logged as having attended, or they have no idea what I'm talking about for project requirements they told and emailed me about, or they simply will not acknowledge project documentation that requires approval, etc.)

I'm starting to feel kinda crazy here. It doesn't help that the managers are using the PO and the scrum master to load work way outside the team's skills and the agreed on purpose for our team into the board over our objections--there's always an emergency and we're told that we should really be feeling sorry for other people if we object to the pile of work, because apparently everyone has it worse?

3. Provide deliverability comparable to a well known email service (gmail, yahoo).
4. Not required to support IMAP/POP3 clients.
5. Support only a single domain and potentially multiple sub-domains.
6. Support for unlimited addresses (left of the '@' delimiter)

Here's my first attempt at an implementation plan.

1. Use AWS SES as a SMTP relay for outbound mail. I don't currently maintain a mail server so the plan is to use the RPC API.
2. Use the SES smtp server for inbound mail (pointing our domain's MX record to SES).
3. Store mails persistently in S3.
4. Verify a single root domain and comply with SPF, DKIM and DMARC.
5. Manage accounts, inboxes and clients by myself.

Does anyone have experience setting something like this up? Is there anything I'm missing?

Some specific problems I'd appreciate help with:

1. How does my choice of AWS SES region affect the end user? I'm assuming just latency but is there something else I should know?
2. There  are two kinds of ""reputations"" I need to keep my eye on. One for the  SES servers itself but also my reputation with SES. Outbound mail that's  flagged by SES's content filters will negatively affect my reputation  with SES. I'd like to implement my own content filters before needing to  hit SES. Does anyone have experience running SpamAssasin (or similar  open source offerings) for a mid-volume system like this? Any SAAS  offerings you would recommend?
3. What's  a good way to manage sending quota and rate? It's difficult to predict  what the usage will be like and I'd like to avoid long periods of  non-delivery. How can I get my allowance (preferably with cushioning)  raised before the service is open to users?
4. Any  recommendations on how I should implement search? SAAS offerings look  very expensive and I'd like to manage elasticsearch only as a last  resort. Load everything into postgres and offer full text search?  Anything else with acceptable functionality but low in development cost?
5. Setting  up inbound with SES hoists a lot of logic on to the AWS layer. Receipt  rules, SNS and S3 are forced by SES (as opposed to Postmark that offers  webhooks for inbound mail). I'd like to keep both outbound and inbound  using the same service provider but any suggestions? This isn't really a  problem per say but since this is a new project I'd like to make a good  decision.

Apologies if this is too broad in scope, but any input would be appreciated :)",SoftwareEngineering,2816,477

"I'm a development manager at a medium sized company that has been using the AS/400 for over a decade now to support all of its business operations. At some point in the last 2 years, the VP decided that it was time we modernize and move onto the cloud. That's when they hired me, putting me in charge of leading that initiative.

The VP told me that he wants this done because he thought AS/400 was now obsolete, and it would become increasingly difficult to find talent.

As someone who has a lot of experience with Azure and AWS, I also thought the system was an absolute dinosaur and that it needed to go. Also, I prefer working with Azure and AWS, so that's another reason I found myself agreeing with the VP.

One year later, I'm not sure if my reasons for wanting to migrate are valid. Is the AS/400 actually obsolete? A quick google says no. Is wanting to get rid of green screens a good enough reason to migrate? I think so, but I'm not sure. Want web applications? The AS/400 can run a web server so you're covered... but that begs the question, if all we're trying to do is create web apps to run on AS/400, couldn't we just as easily host them on the cloud? If we're not writing apps in RPG or COBOL, what's the point?

If I have a single microservice with single db but two read replicas. Is 2pc applicable here?

If I have two seperate microsevices with seperate databases and functionality but one depends on another.  Both need to make changes in db successfully for transaction to be successful. Does 2pc apply here?

For eg:
Step 1 : enter amount in textbox and click submit.
Step 2 : Orders API microservice recieves it and writes it to its database. (here orders acts as co-ordinator) 
This is the prepare request. Orders MS(microservice) tells db to write the transaction but mark status as prepare??
Step 3: Orders MS calls AI MS and tells it to write transaction to its db but mark status as PREPARE??
Step4 : AI MS writes it to db and sends status code 200 back. 
Ste 5: Orders MS now updates its own db and changes status from  PREPARE to DONE 
Step 6. Orders MS now asks AI to mark transaction as Done. 
Step 7. If AI does not sends status code 200 then Orders MS updates it's row to reflect status ABORT. Then it asks  AI MS to do the same. If AI had returned 200 then Orders will mark its row as DONE and ask AI MS to do the same.

I found this strange, as they put a lot emphasis on implementation details, memory allocation and so on. Also master/main is not released very often, but rather like 2-3 times a year.

"We're a platform team at a company with 80 devs. We run an average tech stack with Github Actions for CI, EKS, RDS, nothing fancy. We operate several applications on this system, all microservices. The clear direction from management was to build a developer platform that can help engineers self-serve stuff end to end. ""Stuff"" means:

* roll-back
* new database
* new service
* debug
* configuration management
* RBAC
* Spin up new environments etc.

Why did we decide to do this: operations were just drowning. We spent too much time on repetitive requests from developers that asked stuff in Slack or Jira Tickets. The config files (YAML and Helm) and the maintenance of many teams writing these files freestyle was just not working anymore and led to us long waiting times for everyone. We first trained people around Terraform and Helm but they just didn't want to deal with that and they ended up poking senior developers to fix things instead, which basically created a shadow operations problem on top.

Ok, so we built this platform. I think it went well, we did a good job. It's a GUI and we basically tell it ""if a developer needs an RDS of type A, this is the TF file we execute. We also set baseline YAML files, teams can apply diffs against this like a new Env Var or whatever and we compose the configurations on a deployment by deployment basis. Also takes care of Secrets etc.. Honestly, we are pretty proud of the result and does the job. Our team was excited, EMs too. We spent a lot of time explaining the platform to devs and why it's good for them i.e. they can now self-serve everything end to end without being dependent on us.

Then devs just say ""no"". There's no clear reasoning here, they don't say what is wrong or why they would refuse, they cannot point at any case that we do not cover and there is an easy and clear way of circumventing this system if you feel restricted.

So if you want to do me a favour: can you please share your experience with this stuff? My questions:

* Any idea what is going on inside the developers that makes them reject this?
* What can I do to change their perception? Change the interaction method? Explain it differently? Give them some magic feature that will swing their perception?

"The Gang of Four book states the following:

&gt; [...] The main relationships in MVC are given by the Observer, Composite and Strategy design patterns.

The best example of this I could find was [this][1] github repo, which shows the following class diagram:

[![enter image description here][2]][2]

I'm particularly interested in the Strategy part of the MVC, where the following holds:

| MVC Name           | GoF Name         |
|--------------------|------------------|
| View               | Context          |
| Controller         | Strategy         |
| ConcreteController | ConcreteStrategy |

Regarding the relationship between View and Controller, The book *Head First Design Patterns* states the following:

&gt; The controller may also ask the view to change. When the controller receives an action from the view, it may need to tell the view to change as a result. For example, the controller could enable or disable certain buttons or menu items in the interface

It also shows an example where the `ConcreteController` equivalent `BeatController`) defines an additional association with the `ConcreteView` equivalent (`DJView`):

```java
package headfirst.designpatterns.combined.djview;
  
public class BeatController implements ControllerInterface {
	BeatModelInterface model;
	DJView view;
   
    // BeatController implementation
}
```

This association is not present in the Strategy pattern, which only has an arrow going from `Context` to `Strategy` (and not the other way round). Furthermore, I've seen examples online which also define this association going from the controller to back to the view:

- https://sukhbinder.wordpress.com/2014/12/25/an-example-of-model-view-controller-design-pattern-with-tkinter-python/
- https://www.pythontutorial.net/tkinter/tkinter-mvc/


Is the relationship between Controller and View really only a strategy? If not what is it?

"**Preface:**

Stocks are traded in two ways market orders and limit orders.

* Limit Orders: are orders that have to be executed at a certain specific price only

Example : sell 10 shares of google @ $1000 , this order is stored on the orderbook ready for someone to  buy it (see below)

* Market Orders: are orders that are executed immediately at the best favorable price. In this case, if someone wants to buy 10 shares of Google, the matching algo will check the order book and find the best price e.g *10 shares of google @ $1000*  and mark it as executed (remove from order book)

**Question:**

I have seen various exchanges having extreme capabilities for order execution, some can do 100K+ orders per second. While this is impressive how is this possible?

Since all orders (both limit and market orders) coming into the matching engine have the potential to mutate the same state ( best bid and ask). *How would you scale this?  Just one big box?*

One way is to route each order based on ticker, for example, GOOG go to server1 , TSLA go to server 2

if the only way to do it is per above: 1 ticker -&gt; 1 machine, would there be a theoretical max num orders/sec based on how quickly memory can be read and written.",SoftwareEngineering,1227,225

"The book *Head First Design Patterns* presents [![this UML][1]][1] as an example of the Observer pattern:

What strikes me in this diagram is the association relationship between the `Subject` and `Observer` interfaces. As far as I understand Java interfaces, they cannot implement a ""Has-a"" relationship in this way.

When I look at the implementation example provided a few pages later, I find that sure enough, the interfaces are plain old interfaces:

```
public interface Subject {
  public void registerObserver(Observer o);
  public void removeObserver(Observer o);
  public void notifyObservers;
}

public interface Observer {
  public void update(float temp, float humidity, float pressure);
}

```

Instead, the association relationship is implemented in the concrete `WeatherData` and `Display` classes:

```
public class WeatherData implements Subject {
  private List&lt;Observer&gt; observers;
  //more code
}
```

Which does not correspond to the UML and feels a bit wrong to me. Why not just implement `Subject` as an abstract class instead? Does the UML spec formalize the idea of associating an interface with another interface?

"Hey Everyone,

Just looking to get some design ideas. 

I am working on a message based system. I have a single threaded application. 

From the applications main class it can accept several messages from other applications.

MsgTypeA, MsgTypeB, MsgTypeC, MsgTypeD, MsgTypeE etc. 

From each received Message, the application must do some processing, and then call common code.

For example, after recieving MsgTypeA and MsgTypeC, a list in the class might required to be sorted.

Also, perhaps MsgTypeC and MsgTypeD both require the same response message to be sent. A Message could require multiple callback methods or none at all.

I'm trying to come up with a good design of how to handle all these common code cases that remains maintainable.

A nightmare scario is if I have all these various function calls all over the place and it becomes difficult to know what calls what.

My proposed design was to create some sort of table

\[ MsgType, HandlingFunction, CallbackFunctions...\]

Basically on recieving the message, the defined handling function is called, followed by the callback functions.

At least with that method, I could quickly see the table and understand what gets called.

I can't imagine I'm the first to be considering a design like this. Is anyone familar with any sort of design like this? Or how would you design this!

"Does anyone have a recommended way to expose business rules that do not change very frequently (let’s say 10 times a year) that are consumed by multiple different systems?

Some considerations:

-	These are rules that, by definition, do not make any external calls to get additional information to give a rule result. 
-	The rules should be able to be updated in a rather dynamic way (outside of breaking rule changes like needing a new input field or a new output field on the response).
-	A recommendation by some representatives of the calling systems was to have these rules published somewhere so that they can be cached/consumed in such a way as to not have to make HTTP calls every time these relatively static rules are needed in their application flow. These representatives however could not provide a specific solution that could facilitate this.
-	I’ve used BRMSs like Drools for externalizing business rules in the past but only for applications that I had “control” over. This use case is different in that multiple external applications on different tech stacks will be leveraging these rules 

Additional background:

-	Today, these rules are exposed as a pretty simple HTTP JSON API that takes in high-level info about a new user on request and will give back a response indicating a high-level classification of the user and what additional information needs to be collected from the user.
-	This API is useful to ensure that certain data is collected for a user upfront (while they are actively using the system) so that it does not have to be collected by a manual process later. 

For now, we will stick with our API for consumers to call these rules but I was wondering if anyone had a suggestion on a pub/sub like approach of publishing business rules for our callers to cache to minimize network calls.",SoftwareEngineering,1826,315

    return 0;
  }

}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

Uncomment function `f` in class `B` definition:

# Python

Interfaces don't really exist in python, but they are supposed to be closely approximated by the `Protocol` class in the `typing` module. Abstract base classes do exist in the `abc` module.

What I've found, however, is that the python interpreter never complains about unimplemented behavior **unless** derived class `B` is instantiated.


## Using Abstract Base Class

```python
from abc import abstractmethod, ABC


class A(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def f(self) -&gt; int: ...

class B(A): ...

if __name__== ""__main__"":
	#b = B()
	print(""done"")
```

The following occurs if I comment out line 10:

	- `python test.py` succeeds
	- `mypy --strict test.py` succeeds
	
And the following occurs if I uncomment line 10

	- `python test.py` fails with `TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class B with abstract method f`
	- `mypy --strict test.py` fails with `Cannot instantiate abstract class ""B"" with abstract attribute ""f""`


## Using Protocol

```python
from typing import Protocol
from abc import abstractmethod

class A(Protocol):
    @abstractmethod
    def f(self) -&gt; int: ...

class B(A): ...

if __name__==""__main__"":
  b = B()
  print(""done"")
```

Just like with an abstract base class, the following occurs if I comment out line 10:

	- `python test.py` succeeds
	- `mypy --strict test.py` succeeds
	
And the following occurs if I uncomment line 10

	- `python test.py` fails with `TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class B with abstract method f`
	- `mypy --strict test.py` fails with `Cannot instantiate abstract class ""B"" with abstract attribute ""f""`

# Question

I am not always instantiating the necessary classes which implement protocols or extend abc's in python. So I would like to mimic ""compile"" time interfaces in python, preferrably with `mypy`.

Is this possible? If not, why not?",SoftwareEngineering,3082,473
"We just had an incident where all of our builds suddenly started failing because each build downloads the latest version of one of the libraries from the developer web site, and builds against that, and it turns out we're incompatible with the version they released today. This is not the first time this has happened. One time, the upstream upgrade happened after we'd finished the bulk of our testing, and we didn't notice it was broken until after we'd shipped to customers.

This seems like a problem, but I've not been able to persuade any managers that it's maybe worth our product build not depending on random internet systems we haven't audited and have no control over. Most of my previous jobs have been at much smaller companies, and that's always been pretty routine, but it's apparently unrealistic in bigger products (\~billion dollars a year of revenue, a couple of hundred engineers, eight year old project)?

I dunno. Is this normal at big companies? Should I just lower my expectations?",SoftwareEngineering,1005,170

I’m currently working as a frontend engineer with some years of experience, and while I do pick up a few things from my daily work, it’s still just basically writing some React code, CSS, and so on. So I’m getting the feeling of falling behind for a bit. Some shiny topics have come up recently, of which I have some basic high end knowledge but looking to learn about them more in-depth.

- Micro-frontends 
- PWAs
- Static site generation

"I am working on a project which we got from vendor and the project right now is just imperative with so much tight coupling and no clean code practices.

Now we are thinking to reengineer complete application and thinking to have DDD approach with event driven architecture.

I want to know how do we handle situation where one transaction depends upon the other

**For example**

We have one billing service and other inventory

During billing retailer first selects or add a new customer and then finds a product and if not found create one for his inventory and then that product is available for billing to customers .

So here we have four services customer, billing and inventory, notofocation

As of now we have backend logic sth like this

    import {addCustomer, findCustomer } from './addCustomer'; 
    import {addProductToInventory, findProductInInventory} from './addProductToInventory'; 
    import {notification } from './notificationService'; 
    import {createBill, generateInvoice } from './billingService';  
    const makeBill = async (req, res) =&gt; 
    { 
      let {customer, inventoryProducts, billData} = req.body;    
       const customerId = await findCustomer(customer);   
         if(!customerId){     
           customerId = await addCustomer(customer)   
         }
      inventoryProducts.forEach( product =&gt; {     
            const productId = await findProductInInventory(product);     
            if(!productId){        
                 productId = await addProductToInventory(product);
            }
         }   
    
     let billId = await createBill(customerId, productId, billData);  
      await generateInvoice(billId, billData);  
      notification(billId, billData, userData);     
    return; 
    } 

**If we use some event store and store all the transactions states, How can we handle event if each process depends upon another unless we know the transaction happened ?**

*Note: This is just example of process right now, its is not the implementation of domains, just wanted to know how event driven will work in such situations*",SoftwareEngineering,2094,265

"I work in product analytics/ DS at a tech company on a consumer-facing application with various flavors (web, iOS, android, etc…). Our business is highly volatile and driven by world events so significant seasonality and huge single day swings are common around major events.


We have faced a number of product issues recently and want to stand up monitoring across a large number of metrics related to user activity and user flows. The challenge is that our business is highly volatile and identifying “problematic” trends is really difficult. I want to stand up some kind of model to identify metrics that are moving in unexpected ways. In a way, I’m looking for “outliers” but I don’t want the daily spikes that occur to cause every metric to be flagged that day.


An example to better illustrate…

We recently identified an issue with Android login screens freezing on certain app versions. This issue started the same week as a major volume spike driven by a specific annual event.

-	Due to the volume spike, overall login volume was still up day over day (so no issue detected)
-	Android-only login volume was still slightly up (so no issue detected)
-	Volume for those specific App versions was down slightly from previous days. This didn’t look like a problem without the context that all correlated measures had spike while it did not. This is how we found the issue but was only caught through sheer dumb luck.



Essentially, I have a large system of metrics for all user flows and actions. They are all correlated to some degree and all experience significant volatility. Reviewing and cutting these metrics daily would be a full time job and is not feasible.


So what I’m trying to accomplish… I want to create a model or algorithm to assess metrics on a daily basis and assign a “risk score” of sorts for those who have moved in an unexpected way based on their historical time series and the behavior of all other correlated metrics on that day. Essentially, I want to identify any “anomalies” that occurred that day.

I just graduated in Data Science after a period of stop from studies and for a year I started again and graduated. 

Due to the poor quality of the courses I took, the lack of interesting projects in the exams, and also a bit my fault, for not trying to get passionate about the main courses a data scientist relies on, such as statistics, I feel UNPREPARED for the world of work. 

I love AI, specifically NLP and computer vision but I feel I need to study most of the statistical concepts again before i can try some interviews in a safer way.

"Hello!

I was recently accepted to CS at UCI and data science at UCSD.

I’m completely torn on what to pick.

Non-career factors:

I personally like the beach/startup/chill vibe of UCSD better, though I hear this can also be found at UCI. UCI just seems less exciting to me.

Career factors:

This is where I’m really lost. Me and my parents have asked so many people and we’re really split. People familiar with UCSD’s programs have usually recommended it, while people who work in tech but don’t know specifically about UCSD recommend UCI (including two pretty successful relatives in the tech field).

With regards to my career, I honestly have no idea what I want to do. I want to go into tech for sure, but I’m unsure between swe and ds (leaning ds though—I like stats). Not sure if this is relevant, but I also want to build a business at some point.

I know CS is the better major, but I’ve also heard that UCSD is the better school.

Any advice is appreciated (I got two weeks to make a decision)",datascience,1004,183

Are you considering pursuing a Ph.D. or wondering how to get into machine learning? Before you take the plunge, listen to this insightful interview with Brian Burns, PhD candidate at UW and founder of the AI Pub Twitter account.

But how to get into the AI field without those studies? 🧐

Just jump in projects, and it’s over?

Not really.

You will also most probably need to make money and thus find a job (or create yours like Brian).

Here are some of Brian’s tips on landing this first job… 👇

1️⃣ Personalizing resumes: Brian emphasizes the importance of showcasing quantifiable impacts the candidate has made, whether it’s speeding up a service, improving a model’s performance, or generating revenues for an employer.

2️⃣ The power of brand and online presence: Don’t underestimate the influence of a strong personal brand and an online profile when it comes to recruiting. Share your work, collaborate, and use social media to your advantage.

3️⃣ Build connections: Dive into old-school social networking and start making connections in the industry. Reach out to people on LinkedIn, attend networking events, join online communities, and go the extra mile to stand out in a competitive market.

4️⃣ Share a story: Recruiters know your resume. They’ve read it. Once you get into the interview: share your story! Talk about a project you worked on and the challenges you surpassed. Anything that makes you, you!

Tune in to Brian's interview for insights to get into AI, grow a Twitter page, host a podcast, ace interviews, build a better resume, and more...

While working on this, I encountered a few challenges and would like some feedback and direction about how to approach this. First, is the issue regarding encoding the sub and main genres. I thought of using OneHotEncoder but I would have a really wide dataset. Given that I would have to also vectorize the movie names. A potential workaround would be to group some subgenres together and reduce the 100+ categories. Second, would LabelEncoding the main genre category be the correct approach? Additionally, Given that many movie names have almost very little meaningful information would it still be a good idea to use them regardless? For example, ""Finding Hank"" when preprocessed would just be ""Hank"".

The approach thus far:

1). Preprocessed movie names ( Removed stop words and Stemmed)

2). Vectorized Movie names

3). Encoded Sub genre with OneHotEncoder

4). Encoded Main genre with LabelEncoder

5). Tried to fix model = Disaster.

" Hey r/datascience. 

I come from a business background and over the years have slowly made my way to data analysis and now moving to data science. However, one thing I noticed from other professionals that come from a computer science background is their more intricate knowledge of the tools and their interactions. Mid 2000's. after getting tired of Excel + VBA I started working with SQL. When programming languages became a necessity for my work, I learned Python (also some JavaScript, but that's not here nor there). after getting to the point I needed more number crunching and statistical approaches, I learned R. I don't consider myself an expert, but I at least understand the tools.... separately, at least. Now that I'm formally doing my masters, more than once I have been jumping from software to software, not to mention when doing collaborations (all my work so far was done by me and for me, only the insights and reports needed to be shared, so no one else ever worked on my codes), I have no idea on how to setup everything.   

So, I came here to ask: What is a good workflow and best practices to start with? Currently, most of my work is done either on PyCharm (for more complex coding), Jupiter (for EDA) and RStudio (for R). Regarding git and GitHub, I only ever used it through RStudio (other than the bash shell, of course). However, is there go-to approach where I can use the same tool for everything (or for most part of it)? I know how to do what I need, just not an efficient way to do it specially if I have to work with others.",datascience,1561,282

My current role is an Associate-level Data Scientist, and my target role will be a Senior-level Data Analyst.

I've been posting on here quite a bit and have been really enjoying the responses I've been getting and have been learning a ton.

I had a question about A/B testing with CTR

Let's assume we will run an experiment where CTR is our primary metric, and that our experiment will allocate/sample on a user-level

This means when we calculate sample size and power analysis, this should be done on a user-level, is that correct?

What is the proper way to do this, given ad data is typically on an impression level?

My thoughts:

aggregate on a user-level, where columns are # of impressions, # of clicks, and ctr of each user

your metric is now continuous since it is ctr of each user, and you can calculate the weighted stdev/variance.

"I spent my first few months post-graduation deciding whether to pursue data science or SWE. I ultimately chose the former as it better aligned with my background, but I quickly learned data scientist is not an entry-level role and I must choose something else.

I’ve heard data analyst is a good place to start if you want to become a data scientist, but I’m not too sure if this role is for me. I want to code, work with APIs, scrape the web, automate processes, and develop tools that people can use and I fear that in going the data analyst route, I will be regulated to a very specific set of tasks/tools (e.g., excel), and not be able to do so much of what I enjoy about data science and coding in general.

I’m now considering software developer roles, particularly python developer one, as a means to becoming a data scientist, because I've read this role allows you to do all that I mentioned above. My only qualm is that I don't see python developer to data science paths often (let alone python developer roles), and I'm not sure how to market myself as someone who aspires to become a data scientist but is currently a developer (am I just a developer? A data professional? both?).

Has anyone made the transition from developer to data scientist? What role did you begin with and how did it facilitate your path to a data science role? Are there any other coding-centric roles aside from Python developer that can segue you to data science that I may be missing?

"I'm a recent CS graduate from a Canadian university. In my degree, I took a course in ML and also did my capstone project on DL-generated music. Based on this, I decided I want to learn more about it and pursue a career in DS/ML. In terms of experience, I just have some contract work, and I'm currently working as a research assistant, helping a few profs out with a literature search on AI in healthcare. Based on this, I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for someone like me looking to enter the field?

I've since realized that data science may be the way to go, as it seems any ML positions often require a graduate degree and years of experience. However, I'm finding the same thing with applying to data science jobs. For the jobs that don't ask for years of experience, I often meet all the requirements, however, it's pretty common to find 'entry' level positions asking for 3-5 years of experience... I've had one interview for a data scientist internship at a local company, which I was certain I would get after the interview, but I haven't heard back from them. I'm also finding that I'm not alone in experiencing this. Browsing other posts, I can see that even senior data scientists are having trouble getting hired, which is worrisome. 

I should also mention that I've applied to OMSCS and will likely be accepted. However, my plan was not to start graduate school until after I had worked for about a year in the field. In fact, I'm not 100% tied to the master's at all. I think it's a great option, but I'm also open to working my way up in the industry, aiming to eventually land a job doing applied machine learning.

"*\[Scroll for TLDR\]*

I'm facing a dilemma of choosing between two great schools for my Masters. But the programs are pretty different from each other. I don't know what factors to prioritize. One of my primary objectives is bagging a very **high-paying role** immediately after grad, and continued rapid growth in the next 3 years. I'm an international, and H1B visa is dicey nowadays - I must speedily recover the **\~$110k** I'd be spending at any of the two institutions.

**Bonus comparison** : I also have a **DS** Admit from **University of Rochester**, which will cost me half (with 25% scholarship). Its reviews are all fine, nothing extra-ordinarily good or bad. Could get DS jobs from there too. But isn't in the same league. 

**Brief background** : I have 3 years of experience in Applied Deep Learning research (title being Data Scientist though) and a couple of papers in Vision and RL. I'm extremely fascinated about AGI and concerned for the Safety and Alignment of advanced Intelligence. I have **No** experience in production/deployment or traditional Data Science/analytics/stats. I also hold an MS in Physics and BE in Mechanical Engineering from a premier institute in my country, but with a pretty bad GPA (7/10).

&amp;#x200B;

[**MS Data Science at Columbia**](https://datascience.columbia.edu/education/programs/m-s-in-data-science/)**:**

**Pros**:

* Ivy League, enjoys prestige across the world, including my country, if I return.
* In Manhattan, so a lot of companies come for career fairs. Wouldn't have to move much.
* Alumni in general seem to be well placed in Industry, not necessarily in proper ML roles though.
* Has a nice Effective Altruism student chapter, focuses on AI Safety etc.

**Cons**:

* **Extremely** [**Shitty core curriculum**](https://datascience.columbia.edu/education/programs/m-s-in-data-science/#curriculum) \- just 3 basic applied stats and 3 basic CS courses thrown together. No real data science or machine learning.
* Unimpressive choice of electives- More parallel to an analytics degree.
* Only 3 electives allowed. Applied ML and DL are electives and not core, so will occupy 2 spaces.
* Needlessly terse and theoretically rigorous. People do have trouble keeping up.
* Living in the hustle-bustle of costly NYC can be a pain.
* **200-250+ batch** size, can lead to higher competition.
* People here all have 9.2+ /10 GPA in undergrad. I got admitted somehow at 7, probably historic. May not fare well or fit with the kind of perseverant students here.  Also heard most here are pretty snobby and elitist.
* Grade deflation, so may lag behind in class, I'm not hard-working at all.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[**MS Artificial Intelligence at Northwestern**](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/artificial-intelligence/overview/)**:**

**Pros:**

* Also enjoys a very high repute, and a Top 10 US News National Universities rank (Does it matter?)
* **Excellent** [**core curriculum**](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/artificial-intelligence/curriculum/msai-traditional.html). Proper ML, DL, AI, NLP, HCI courses with great syllabi covering breadth of AI.
* [**GOD-TIER electives**](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/artificial-intelligence/curriculum/courses.html), long list from Modern DL, core CS, advanced Robotics, PM, what not. One I was boggled by was ""[Artificial Life](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jURIbvpQ0imcaMk-AHUmj_szZNtsA4lZAlcqXa6usXs/edit)"". Many other dreamy, futuristic courses (but not hand-wavy). Some courses also cover [Superintelligence](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/artificial-intelligence/curriculum/descriptions/comp-sci-496-23.html) and other AI Safety stuff.
* Most courses like Deep Generative Models, RL, Artificial Vision etc are updated with the current **state-of-the-art**. The NLP core course also has 30 papers to read from 1950s to GPT-3. Has many other seminar-based PhD level courses too.
* Does not focus too much on maths/stats apart from a few Data Science related courses, just enough theoretical and formal depth in most courses.
* Most courses have a significant project component (usually free to choose), and regular assignments involving the latest frameworks and architectures . PyTorch is used throughout the curriculum.
* Lots of industry seminars, projects etc. Generally good industrial connections. Companies come and give projects, can also sometimes convert to full-time/internships.
* Can also take Entrepreneurship and other great courses from the amazing Kellogg school.
* Only **40 people cohort**. Uni is more responsive to needs of the batch and each individual.
* Grade Inflation, so no worries about performing better relative to others.
* Meticulously selected 40 students with generally 3+ years of experience in AI : so elevated rigour of projects and more to learn from others, stronger personal connections (though I'm an introvert).
* Evanston is a more placid and calm place to get lost in studies for 1.3 years.

**Cons**:

* The AI program is newer and not as well-known, or considered a feeder into the industry yet. I don't know if the repute of Northwestern in the industry matches Columbia or falls short enough to make a difference (or exceeds??). The alumni seem not as well-placed but difficult to judge ratios etc. from linkedin.
* The research prowess of the dept isn't as great (evident by cs-rankings). The proffs at NU aren't well-established as AI researchers. The teaching is also sometimes underwhelming from what I heard from current students. But I'm a self-learner anyway, will do with Stanford/UCB lectures.
* Could be a really heavy courseload as well, since it's a quarter system with about 4-5 courses each quarter. Would want to take even more since there's no extra cost to add the lovely electives.
* Evanston/even Chicago isn't really a great place to be for Tech ? I'd have to relocate to NYC/SF later. Though I do love Chicago from its beautiful pictures, the crime-rate could be a concern.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR : Curriculum vs Prestige?

That is, **If** there is a significant prestige difference b/w NU and Columbia, and **if** it matters and plays an actual physical role in an ML/AI career. Also, does NYC play any real role (Isn't networking virtual anyways?)

Imho there's nothing good with Columbia DS apart from recognition, and NU's AI curriculum is one of the greatest in the world. But finally, I would need a job, and for that Columbia may have higher mileage. NU may give me cool AI stuff to chew on for my life though and lead to desired opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

**Did I aim too low ?**

I'm oscillating between disbelief/ imposter syndrome at getting these admits, and regretting not applying to **Berkeley/Stanford/CMU** etc. I had passed most deadlines when I started to apply (this Feb). 

I was told I wouldn't get anywhere at all due to my poor grades, misaligned background, and super-late timing of applications. Removed and added NU and Columbia from my final shortlist multiple times, coz never thought I'd get in. NU already seemed full, they had specifically instructed to not apply after Dec 15, if you want to be considered fully, lol. Only a handful of expensive Unis's deadlines remained by March, which became my automatic shortlist.

I work in a slow paced environment, where I feel my skills are kind of wasted and haven’t really been developing much lately. The biggest issues are the lack of data and the fact that I am basically the only data scientist in the company.

"Hey guys,

It is difficult enough to land any interviews at all rn, but then you have to deal with the recruiters who cannot even do their jobs. I recently had a negative experience with Capital One for a data science position. Details are below:

* I was reached out by a recruiter from C1 about 2 weeks ago, asking for my availability for a 30 mins interview. I responded within that day my availability for that week and the week after.
* Recruiter responded 5 days later, agreeing to schedule a call at 3PM the day after
* The day after, recruiter sent me an email right before the call, saying that he needed to push back the call to the next day. I agreed and provided him with my availability for that day. Recruiter did not send any confirmation response.
* The day after that, recruiter emailed me at 2:40PM, asking me if he could call at 3PM. I was in a meeting at the time, but still agreed to take the call and left the meeting early.
* Recruiter never called at 3PM. He sent an email at 4:30PM stating that “something came up that was very time-sensitive,” without any apology, and offered to reschedule for 6 PM that day or the next day. Again, I replied with an agreement to take the call at 6PM
* Recruiter never called at 6PM.
* The next day, I sent another email to recruiter, but this time, I copied Capital One's main careers/HR email address. He called me within a minute after I sent the email (lol).
* The call lasted for 5 mins, for what was supposed to be a 30 mins call. He asked me basic questions like salary expectations, and relocation. I was not even asked ""Do you have any other questions about this role?""
* Recruiter said he would forward my resume to 2 hiring managers, and would let me know what they think. I asked for the hiring manager's names, and he said he would send me their linkedin profiles in a follow-up email.
* Of course, I never received this follow-up email. I sent him an email asking for the hiring managers' contact info. He never replied.
* Early morning the next day, I received a rejection email. Mind you, our call was around 5PM the previous day. This made me wonder whether my resume was ever forwarded to the hiring managers at all.

TL,DR: Was flaked on 3 times by C1's recruiter. Finally got a super brief call because I copied the main HR email address in the chain. Got rejected the next day.

What do you think I should have done differently in this process? Also, I was thinking about sending a feedback for this process to the main HR address, but not sure if this would be the right move?",datascience,2558,480

Hi, I am learning ML and, working on Simple Linear Regression, for that I have created a 200\*2 matrix **(In Step 1)**

Here first column of Matrix will be my X and 2nd column will my Y. 

But since its random therefor there is no linear relation between X and Y. 

So, my YouTube tutor , created a random matrix of 2\*2  **(In Step 2)** and did a ***dot product of 200\*2 matrix and this 2\*2 matrix.***

 ***(correct me If im wrong), what a dot product does, is its give us a number, showing how much two vector points are close to each other.***

So, by doing dot product in step2 we are just checking distance of all points from 2\*2 matric vectors,

but , How can this step2 leads to controlled scattering of data points, ideal for linear relationship.

" I'm working on a binary classification problem and need some help in evaluating my model's performance. I have two datasets, 'train' and 'test', and my dataset has a large number of features. I used UMAP with n\_components=2 to reduce the dimensions and plotted the points.

I found that there are distinct regions where the majority of points are either class 0 or 1, suggesting that my model should be able to classify them easily. However, there is an area where the two labels overlap, making it more challenging for my model to predict the correct class.

In this overlapping region, there are many training samples but very few test samples. As a result, my model achieves an F1 score of 0.75 for the training set and 0.96 for the test set, which are significantly different.

Here's an image of the distribution of train and test points with 1 being train samples and 0 being test samples.

"Apologies for cross-posting with /r/Python, but this is particularly relevant to many data science practitioners.

We're excited to announce the release of a new data visualization toolkit: Highcharts for Python! 

It's a collection of Python libraries designed to provide turn-key comprehensive support for Highcharts data visualizations in Python, including native integrations with Pandas, Jupyter, PySpark, GeoPandas, ESRI, and more. If you're unfamiliar with Highcharts, it is one of the leading Javascript data visualization solutions, used to easily create highly interactive, beautifully styled data visualizations with over 150 different chart types. Using the Highcharts for Python toolkit, you can easily integrate this rich set of visualization capabilities into your Notebooks and analytical apps.

The toolkit includes full support for the Highcharts suite of data visualization libraries, including Highcharts Core, Highcharts Stock, Highcharts Maps, and Highcharts Gantt. Full disclosure, the libraries are free to try, but like all of the Highcharts visualization products, using them commercially requires a license with extensive (human) support. 

You can find the Github repos for the full toolkit at [https://github.com/highcharts-for-python](https://github.com/highcharts-for-python), more details about what the toolkit can do at [https://highchartspython.com/integrations/python](https://highchartspython.com/integrations/python), and extensive documentation at [https://highchartspython.com/get-help](https://highchartspython.com/get-help).

"I got accepted into three graduate DS programs: Applied Data Science at USC, Data Science at U. of Rochester, and Data Science at Vanderbilt. 

It's very exciting to receive offers from all three, but I'm having a headache trying to figure out which one would be the best choice for my future.  

&amp;#x200B;

Let me give you a bit of background about myself. 

I don't have any education or career background in DS. I've worked in a different area for a couple of years but got attracted to DS. So I don't have much knowledge in programming and still exploring sectors where I want to work. (IT and Energy seem interesting though.)

When I think about USC, I feel it would give me more opportunities in the field considering its location and reputation. California is known for IT and Energy Industry, and I've heard USC has a great network. 

Vanderbilt is also an amazing school and what I like about their program is that they provide introduction courses. As I'm a complete novice, I think that would be important to consider..? (If you have a similar experience, please share your experience)

U of R is the best from the financial perspective as they've offered a 50% scholarship. The tuition goes down to 35K+ while USC and Vanderbilt are 78K, 100K. Considering the high living costs in LA and Nashville, I guess the cost of getting a diploma from these two schools would be way more expensive...

" Hey all,

I need to predict when a machine will hit a threshold for wear amount (The machine will be replaced once the threshold is met), where the current wear of the machine is measured about once a month. One of the biggest causes of wear is when the machine is in use, which happens a couple times a month. There are also other factors which affect this machine's wear rate, including temperature, ect.

By looking at the scatter graph of wear amount against time, it looks to be mostly linear, although the rate is different depending on which machine I am looking at (because of the previously mentioned wear rate factors), the rate for one machine also periodically changes based on other factors not mentioned.

I was going to go down the RUL approach for this problem with Survival Analysis, however before I do this, I was wondering if anyone had any advice or a better approach to use (neural network or some other form of regression). Since the current wear amount is not measured very frequently, how should the input data for the model be structured to account for these gaps of data?

From a purely anecdotal perspective, it feels that the hiring bar for data scientists has gone up and is all over the place. I might be wrong, but it felt that 5 years ago if you knew A/B testing + jupyter notebooks it was good enough.

* MLE leaning roles will ask for knowledge on how to productize DS projects. Knowledge of AWS and containers is sort of expected.
* DS roles expect at least some idea of how neural networks work, sometimes how transformers work.

"I have been playing around with Causal Forests through the econML package but causal inference in general is quite new to me.

I've read some interesting literature about how these types of random forest models can be thought of as an adaptive nearest neighbor approach which ""learns"" which features are most important in determining neighborhoods, rather than just using a standard distance calc across all features.

There are lots of tools around determining which features are important (SHAP values, feature importances, etc.), but I was wondering if there was a way to use these models to determine the most similar data points based on this adaptive neighborhood idea (i.e. something like how many leaves they are in together, or % of times they are on the same side of a split, etc.).

I know I can compare on the actual output, but I was also thinking there would be cases where different subgroups might have similar outcomes spuriously despite having different features (i.e. w.r.t. housing price regression: small shore houses having similar price ranges to large suburban homes, despite being very different).

There’s some other requirements that I’m even more uniquely qualified for but its too much detail for a throw away account. 

I frankly don’t know how anyone could have my unique combination of requirements to meet this role. The concern I have is that I’m interviewing with folks that are all lawyers. How do I both impress them with my data science knowledge but not overwhelm them with terminology they aren’t familiar with. I know what the goals of the data analysis is for the role, have some thoughts on data they could gather that they probably aren’t (I have found some reports they’ve released in the past), and have some ideas on how machine learning could be used to meet the end goal. I’m just concerned about translating that for non-data science people, especially the machine learning piece. 

I’d really just love any tips for interviewing for a data heavy role with non-data folks. How do you leave an impression without them thinking you are just making up things? 😂",datascience,1230,218

"Hello everyone, 

I saw yesterday that a data analyst job in what I consider to be my dream company was open. I couldn't believe it because this company doesn't usually hire in the city I'm in! Here comes my issue. I am a noob data analyst. I just finished my post-grad in econ after three grueling years, but due to some financial bumps, I've been working my ass off during that time to survive and did not start getting into any sort of statistical analysis language even though I knew I kinda had to in order to compete in the market, but working three jobs and pulling off a masters was really hard, and I only just finished it. I literally had just finished this [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/r-programming/?utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=udemyads&amp;utm_campaign=LongTail_la.EN_cc.ROW&amp;utm_content=deal4584&amp;utm_term=_._ag_77879424134_._ad_535397279649_._kw__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-1007766171312_._li_9043483_._pd__._&amp;matchtype=&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwoIqhBhAGEiwArXT7K5zDFkGOFssuVOMXWu8W6kiSVxA_kPg7rPua1LEBgKitmUqM79jmphoC_ZMQAvD_BwE) course on R (the reason I'm learning R and not Python is that the course was a gift from someone) when I saw the posting, and I plan on finishing the last part of the swirl package tonight.   


Some parts of the job requirement include: ""Experience in SQL and ability to work with large amounts of data. Data collection, data processing, data cleaning and analysis using essential python libraries (e.g. Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels etc.)."" I am still a noob in R. I got used to all the hotkeys and shortcuts and know the essential packages and their functions, and I also found it fun to use, but I'm pretty inexperienced obviously, so I'm doing small stuff right now to practice.

However, I would love to work at this place; it would be instant for me! My question is, if I try to learn some Python within the next two weeks before this position hits the deadline--and I know this is grasping for straws here-- but, do you think I can apply and have a real shot? Or should I just accept that it isn't happening this time?

"Good morning everyone, I am doing a data science project, and I am looking for recommendations/tips that can help me to carry it out. 

The project is based on predicting monthly sales of a certain product. At the beginning of each month (around day 5-6), we are provided with an estimate of monthly sales. In addition, as the month progresses, more and more daily sales become visible, which allows us to better estimate the total monthly sales. The idea is to create a model that, for each day of the month based on the daily sales up to that day and the initial estimate, predicts the monthly sales value. Additionally, we also have information about the number of working days per month. 

Any recommendations for models/papers would be more than welcome.",datascience,759,131

" Hi all,

I am a motivated and passionate 20-year-old who is interested in pursuing a career in data science. I completed a year of data engineering and received a cum laude (77%) grade, but I found the way my university taught frustrating. They taught for exams instead of pure learning, and it didn't prepare me for industry readiness. Additionally, I wasn't interested in the engineering aspect of data, so I realized that continuing with this degree wouldn't benefit me in the long run.

I have taken a year off to reevaluate my career goals and have developed a plan to enter the field of data science without a degree. My plan includes taking online courses from DataCamp and Coursera, building a community of people to work on projects, doing internships, and writing about data science on my blog (the Data Kid). I believe that this will equip me with the skills and experience I need to get a job in the field.

However, I am aware that the field of data science is highly competitive, and many employers prefer candidates with degrees. Therefore, I would appreciate any advice from experts in the field who may have gone through a similar journey or have experience hiring candidates without degrees.

Thank you in advance for your insights and guidance.",datascience,1264,217

I am working on a manufacturing data that is fairly new (only has 60 batches produced so far) dataset size is 60 observations of 150 variables and I am building a PLS model to predict the Final Product quantity in Kgs that meets minimum specifications. After removing intermediate product measurements, redundant variables, calculated variables to avoid Colinearity I am left with 60 observations of 110 variables. This PLS model has predictability only at 23% and more than 70% of the variables have huge variations in their data so far. My thoughts are this process data is too early and not sufficient to make a predictive PLS model but I would like to get some expert opinions on this situation. Can I assume adding more observations to this data helps the model? Is there any basic data health check I am missing for PLS modeling before I submit the outcomes to my manufacturing team?

"So, I work for a very large company in their finance department. I recently got a new role on the data analytics team, and to my surprise, it seems like no one knows anything about data science, analytical methods, or best practices. 

A bit about myself, for the past 2 years, I've been teaching myself data science in order to get ahead. In this time, I've become really fluent in python, SQL, VBA, and general concepts such as ETL, wrangling...etc. I've also been able to use a lot of what I've learned in my current role. I'm by no means an expert, but I've been able to make some good progress at work with what I've done so far.

Back to the new role. I had a couple of interviews with my new boss and director, and started describing the ETL process I do for email data. They had never heard of ETL. Beyond that, someone from their team reached out to me later and asked if I could help them find the name for a database in MS SQL. When I asked what type of data they were looking for they sent me a screenshot of the table with db name attached. It seemed as if they didn't understand the difference between a db, server, or table.

Broadly speaking, people aren't using analytics/BI packages for reporting (even though they are available). Instead, there is a culture of making direct SQL queries against the database.

I am analysing a dataset of all premier league games from the 2010/11 season to the 2019/20 season. What I am trying to do is analyse the conversion rate (goals scored per game/shots taken per game) and create a distribution. I am not sure if I should use a normal distribution or a binomial distribution as the conversion rate is technically a proportion of success divided by trials. So far this what I have tried but I am not sure if I am going about this correctly.

Firstly I tried using a normal distribution as when I divide the goals per game/shots taken per game I get continuous values, expect for some zeros which are the games where no goals were scored. However the data is not completely normal, so I artificially normalised by doing log(1+goals per game/shots taken per game). While it did not create a huge difference, the data is more normal now. Would I just create a normal distribution and find the mean and variance using the values given by the log transformation?

The other approach I took was using the binomial distribution as my population is large and it approximates the normal distribution. Firstly I used

E(x)=mu=nP

Var(x)=nP(1-P)

But I was not sure if this was correct because this would be a distribution of the number of successes, which is the goals scored. But that is not what I want to analyse, I want to analyse the conversion rate.

So instead I tried using the proportion random variable.

P=X/n (where X is the number of successes, goals scored)

mu=P

Var(x)=(P(1-P))/n

I would just like some advice on which approach is the best and makes the sense for what I am trying to do. Any help is appreciated and thanks in advance.",datascience,1785,318

"Hi everyone! 

I'm considering an MS in data science, preferably an online, affordable, and fairly reputable program. My undergrad background is in applied math and statistics. I took Intro to Python and R in my freshman and junior years, respectively, but have not used them since, so I need to start from scratch. I had been working as a data analyst at a startup firm for 1.5 years (unfortunately got laid off recently). I gained valuable experience in the business domain (quantitative marketing) and, had a chance to use SQL and analytical tools like Tableau to solve real-world problems.

Since I'm job hunting right now, I have time on my hands. I would also like to keep my knowledge intact and upgrade my skills in data science. In the past, I have taken a data analytics BootCamp (a suggestion from someone at the time and based on the restrictions I faced from my student visa in pursuing MS and working at the same time); I didn't like it and regretted it, to be honest. I learned SQL but also useless tools like Microsoft SSRS and SSIS; thankfully, my supervisor advised me to study Tabluea as these are becoming obsolete. I have also tried taking courses on Udemy and Coursera in the past, but I cannot properly finish a course on time, and it's very hard for me to excel in self-paced programs. Also, you can retake the quizzes/assignments several times, which makes the whole process fairly easy compared to a real university class. 

I really enjoy university-style learning, but I have a limited budget, need to start soon, and cannot afford to pay \~50k and more. I would also like to start this summer and take classes at an accelerated rate. Even if an in-person MS program is my first choice, my situation brings me back to the self-paced online master's programs.  I have researched a few programs so far:  


* Eastern University MS in DS: affordable but not reputable, has mixed reviews
* Western Governors University Master’s in Data Analytics Degree: affordable but not reputable. Plus, it's data analytics, and I'm planning to focus more on DS.
* Georgia Tech Online Master of Science in Analytics: affordable, reputable, but the next start date is ambiguous (it currently says Spring 2024, which is too far for me)

Could anyone please give me your opinion on these programs or other programs based on your experience? I'd really appreciate it! I would like to start as soon as possible.",datascience,2416,417

We all have heard an uncountable amount of predictions about how AI will ***terk err jerbs!***

However, here we have a proper study on the topic from OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania. They investigate how Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) could automate tasks across different occupations \[1\].

Although I’m going to discuss how the study comes with a set of “imperfections”, the findings still make me really excited. The findings suggest that machine learning is going to deliver some serious productivity gains.

People in the data science world fought tooth and nail for years to squeeze some value out of incomplete data sets from scattered sources while hand-holding people on their way toward a data-driven organization. At the same time, the media was flooded with predictions of omniscient AI right around the corner.

*Let’s dive in and take an* exciting glimpse into the future of labor markets\*!\*

# What They Did

The study looks at all US occupations. It breaks them down into tasks and assesses the possible level of for each task. They use that to estimate how much automation is possible for a given occupation.

The researchers used the [O\*NET database,](https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html) which is an occupation database specifically for the U.S. market. It lists 1,016 occupations along with its standardized descriptions of tasks.

The researchers annotated each task once manually and once using GPT-4. Thereby, each task was labeled as either somewhat (&lt;50%) or significantly (&gt;50%) automatable through LLMs. In their judgment, they considered both the direct “exposure” of a task to GPT as well as to a secondary GPT-powered system, e.g. LLMs integrated with image generation systems.

To reiterate, a higher “exposure” means that an occupation is more likely to get automated.

Lastly, they enriched the occupation data with wages and demographic information. This was used to determine whether e. g. high or low-paying jobs are at higher risk to be automated.

So far so good. This all sounds pretty decent. Sure, there is a lot of qualitative judgment going into their data acquisition process. However, we gotta cut them some slag. These kinds of studies always struggle to get any hard data and so far they did a good job.

However, there are a few obvious things to criticize. But before we get to that let’s look at their results.

# Key Findings

The study finds that 80% of the US workforce, across all industries, could have at least some tasks affected. Even more significantly, 19% of occupations are expected to have at least half of their tasks significantly automated!

Furthermore, they find that higher levels of automation exposure are associated with:

* Programming and writing skills
* Higher wages (contrary to previous research!)
* Higher levels of education (Bachelor’s and up)

Lower levels of exposure are associated with:

* Science and critical thinking skills
* Manual work and tasks that might potentially be done using physical robots

This is somewhat unsurprising. We of course know that LLMs will likely not increase productivity in the plumbing business. However, their findings underline again how different this wave is. In the past, simple and repetitive tasks fell prey to automation.

*This time it’s the suits!*

If we took this study at face value, many of us could start thinking about life as full-time pensioners.

But not so fast! This, like all the other studies on the topic, has a number of flaws.

# Necessary Criticism

First, let’s address the elephant in the room!

OpenAI co-authored the study. They have a vested interest in the hype around AI, both for commercial and regulatory reasons. Even if the external researchers performed their work with the utmost thoroughness and integrity, which I am sure they did, the involvement of OpenAI could have introduced an unconscious bias.

*But there’s more!*

The occupation database contains over 1000 occupations broken down into tasks. Neither GPT-4 nor the human labelers can possibly have a complete understanding of all the tasks across all occupations. Hence, their judgment about how much a certain task can be automated has to be rather hand-wavy in many cases.

Flaws in the data also arise from the GPT-based labeling itself.

The internet is flooded with countless sensationalist articles about how AI will replace jobs. It is hard to gauge whether this actually causes GPT models to be more optimistic when it comes to their own impact on society. However, it is possible and should not be neglected.

The authors do also not really distinguish between labor-augmenting and labor-displacing effects and it is hard to know what “affected by” or “exposed to LLMs” actually means. Will people be replaced or will they just be able to do more?

Last but not least, lists of tasks most likely do not capture all requirements in a given occupation. For instance ""making someone feel cared for"" can be an essential part of a job but might be neglected in such a list.

# Take-Away And Implications

GPT models have the world in a frenzy - rightfully so.

Nobody knows whether 19% of knowledge work gets heavily automated or if it is only 10%.

As the dust settles, we will begin to see how the ecosystem develops and how productivity in different industries can be increased. Time will tell whether foundational LLMs, specialized smaller models, or vertical tools built on top of APIs will be having the biggest impact.

In any case, these technologies have the potential to create unimaginable value for the world. At the same time, change rarely happens without pain. I strongly believe in human ingenuity and our ability to adapt to change. All in all, the study - flaws aside - represents an honest attempt at gauging the future.

Efforts like this and their scrutiny are our best shot at navigating the future. Well, or we all get chased out of the city by pitchforks.

Jokes aside!

What an exciting time for science and humanity!

"I am aware that there are tons of career advice questions on this sub, and that they may have become a bit tedious. Nevertheless, I think this sub is full of experienced, intelligent people who may have faced similar situations, and my decision making process is at a point where new input is needed. Therefore, I humbly ask for your advice.

At 39 years old, I have a BS/MS in Physics, a PhD in theoretical physics (many-body physics / quantum chemistry) and a BS in Business Administration with some economics. Very good grades throughout, although only from standard mid tier German universities. 

Since my graduation I have been working in the German automotive industry, for over 8 years now, in some kind of data architect / data science role, but of the very basic kind. I use intermediate SQL and some pyspark in databricks, also a few tools of the Azure toolstack, as well as visualization (Tableau etc). No ML at all, although I am very interested in learning. I did use Fortran, SAS and some other niche stuff in my PhD, but forgot all of it. Was a long time ago. My knowledge was limited to ""let's stackoverflow how to do this"".

My main strength is translating business needs into data structures and processes, and I hired/built a small team of five over the years. The management aspect works very well, we are five buddies having fun, we have zero fluctuation, and our output is way beyond all the other colleagues in our organization. Since most of these other colleagues are ""business excel people"", they depend on me and I have a lot of privileges like 90% remote and having the say when I want to go on vacation. I also don't work too much, about 35-40h with half of the time being meetings.

The catch: the pay is below my potential (90k$ TC), with the high taxation and medium living cost of Germany. My company (and most others here) have very narrow salary bands and seniority is more important than qualifications, so a slacking off senior employee is earning more than me. Even the management level jobs are not paid much better. I am also not optimistic about where the industry is heading and about the German economy as a whole, so I'd prefer to get out.

I basically have three options:
1. Join the ranks of slacking off senior employees over the time, making my past achievements, qualifications and potential irrelevant. The low stress variant, which doesn't sit right with me though.
2. Self-teach DS to a certain degree and try to look for a tier 2 management job in the US which doesn't need hands-on experience in being an ""actual"" data scientist. I have yet to find an example of such a job, most require real experience in serious problems. Maybe it's just a question how well I am selling my work experience though.
3. Self-teach DS hardcore and ""start over"" as a non-management DS beginner. Given my age, I am not sure this would work, and it would not properly utilize the (soft) skills I have gained in my current line of work.

Maybe I am completely on the wrong track and another kind of role would be more suitable for me. I found that I am better with people and more inexperienced with programming than a Physics PhD might suggest, but I bring the analytical skills, efficiency and willingness to learn that usually comes with it.

Do you maybe have examples of jobs that would fit my profile? A low-medium stress role that is bridging the gap between business and analytics/data, possibly as a manager? What would you do in my situation?

"Hello,

I apologize in advance if this is a redundant question, I wasn't able to find much to answer my questions on this subreddit.

I graduated in December with an M.S. in Data Science. I graduated with a B.S. in Mathematics in 2018, and between 2018 and 2021 I spent 1 year doing data analysis, program support, database administration at a non-profit and then 2 years doing some financial data analysis at a small investment consulting firm. In November, I received a job offer for a DS &amp; DE rotational program with a start date in July. I got this opportunity by speaking to an HR manager who attended my university's career fair and submitting an app / doing interviews after. Since then, I have continued in my job search because I would prefer to start working earlier and I also want to keep the door open to more opportunities given the way things are in the market right now. I have applied to over 400 roles by using LinkedIn, my university career center's website, Glassdoor and just generally googling different companies and applying on their website. Aside from my offer, I only got one interview, which was just for a financial analyst role and nothing related to DS/DE which is what I want to do. I am starting to get very anxious about what I am doing wrong, but I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. I've received feedback on my resume from people in the workforce and I edited it thanks to VMock as well. I am not sure what else to do. I know already I won't have the most competitive edge given ""entry level"" DS/DE don't exactly exist but of course, I need some way to break into the industry given I only have my M.S. in this field, but don't have real world professional experience in DS &amp; DE.

"The question: Have doctors fled Twitter since Elon Musk became CEO?

Here's what I did to try to answer this problem.

* Visualized my data:
   * I made a line chart of Twitter weekly activity by doctors in our panel from 2010 to now. 
   * The graph shows that they increased activity on Twitter from 2010-2016, then started decreasing activity from 2017-present. I don't know why. 
   * Activity looks like it drops off on Thanksgiving and Christmas, and during the summer.
* Tried to model the 2017-present decline using OLS from python's [statsmodels package](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.regression.linear_model.OLS.html):
   * I have dummy variables for each year in the dataset. The coefs are negative (p&lt;0.001).
   * Dummy variables for the weeks of Thanksgiving and Christmas. Coefs are negative (p&lt;0.001).
   * Dummy variable for the summer months (1 if month = \[6,7,8\] else 0). Coef is negative (p&lt;0.001).
   * A dummy variable for `elon_ceo` which is active after Oct 27, 2022. Coef is negative (p&lt;0.001).

It fits very well. Adjusted r-squared is 0.92. 

However, I really don't think I can conclude that Elon's reign has actually reduced Twitter activity for the people in our panel. Sure, activity is declining and the decline was a little bit more pronounced this year, but that's happened before. The percent change YoY for each of the weeks of 2023, for example, is certainly higher than previous years but it's not really extreme.

I wouldn't be surprised if I landed in a data analyst role.

What were your first data science roles/titles? Is it unrealistic to be hired as a Data Scientist as a fresh graduate with 6 months of data science internship experience? Should I instead be looking at Data Analyst/Business Intelligence type roles at first? I'm just worried that I will be stuck in a Data Analyst role where I won't be gaining the necessary experience to be a Data Scientist. 

Thanks in advance!",datascience,857,151
"Hello,

I am currently an undergrad in Statistics and Data Science that is looking for an internship this summer. The big issue I have is that I have applied to many different internships, but they either just don't respond, or give me the generic (you're impressive, but not impressive).

"Hey all. I am looking for some advice on getting a masters. 

My undergrad was in philosophy with a math minor. I took an online boot camp during lockdown, I worked freelance for awhile, and now have been in an analyst position for the past year. 

I am debating between pursuing a masters in statistics or data science and I would love to hear what you’re experience are with both. 

As I see it, I am more interested in statistics but I don’t know that I need more stats training. I stay up to date on common stats and work in business analytics and, practically speaking, don’t deal with more than histograms and normalization. I don’t see myself leaving a business analytics role and while I am certainly not a stats expert, I know it well enough to be a respected resource in my role. 

I am also considering a data science master but I am not sure that it would be much more than applied statistics and some technical training. My technical skills are strong enough that I don’t need to develop them much further (I work regularly in SQL, Python, and BI) unless I wanted to expand into more data pipelining. (Which, frankly, I don’t. My soft skills are strong enough that my company relies on me to communicate the more difficult concepts to clients and I plan to leverage my communication skills as my largest asset for my future career)

While I do believe furthering my education is always a good investment ( and something I would enjoy) I am struggling to see they payoff for either of these options outweighing the cost.

Ideally the strength of the penalty should be a parameter the user can fiddle with to decide a best model.

I have a number of ideas of how to do this: 

bayesian regression, with priors set to be equal to the original model coefs  ( think this will be too slow on large datasets though)

The **statistics** vs **DL** vs **ML** debate on time-series forecasting is extremely controversial:

* **Deep learning methods** have gained a lot of attention in recent years for their ability to capture complex patterns in data and make accurate predictions.
* However, **statistical methods** have been around for much longer and have proven to be reliable and interpretable.

So, I did an extensive research using sources from both academia and the industry. I published the results in my latest article.

This week’s story sounds like it was taken straight from a science fiction novel.

The leaders of the Church are shaking in fear because of what AI could bring to light.

Thousands of years ago, a massive volcanic eruption wiped out a monumental city in a matter of hours. Among the thousands of destroyed houses was one very special estate. It belonged to a close relative of the most powerful Kaiser that ever lived.

On his estate was a vast library filled with thousands of papyrus scrolls of unspeakable value.

The scrolls contain texts from long-lost secrets about philosophy, science, and possibly even about the origins of modern religions. When the house was destroyed along with the library, the conditions under the scorching hot lava miraculously preserved the scrolls. Under the stone, the scrolls survived for thousand of years.

The scrolls were discovered but have become so fragile that they cannot be opened anymore without destroying them. So, scientists are using modern particle accelerators and AI to unlock the secrets hidden in them. A price of $1M will go to whoever manages to read the scrolls first.

*Pretty good no?*

The best part about this story is that it is not made up. Okay, I might have been adding some drama in my depiction of church leaders shaking under their cassocks. I am pretty sure they neither know what is going on nor are they reading this newsletter.

In this week's edition, we will look at a spine-tingling story behind the [Vesuvius Challenge](https://scrollprize.org/) and see how computer vision can help to unlock the secrets of the past.

Let’s jump in!

**What Actually Happened**

In 79 AD the Vesuvius volcano erupted and buried the city of Pompeii. What very few people know is that multiple cities were also destroyed in the incident. One of these cities was Herculaneum.

We can think of Herculaneum as the Beverly Hills of Pompeii.

The city was full of marvelous villas and estates. One of the more impressive ones belonged to Caesar’s father-in-law. It goes without saying, the guy was very powerful, well-connected, and super-rich.

[Example img\_name](https://preview.redd.it/3nqjl5y984ta1.png?width=422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6f987590c03ca582d1af828c01eee2277c7f2d50)

Estate of Caesar’s father-in-law

Inside his estate was a giant library full of scrolls from the Greek and Roman times.

When the villa was destroyed, the heat of the lava carbonized (turning to charcoal without burning) the scrolls. This has preserved them for almost 2000 years. Since the 18th century, different groups tried to dig up the scrolls.

To date, more than 1800 scrolls have been excavated and most-likely there are many more under ground.

Some people speculate that his library might even contain scrolls from the library of Alexandria that burned down a few years before. From these scrolls, we might discover completely new philosophical schools, scientific secrets of the Greeks, and *heck!* maybe drafts of the bible with GPT watermarks on them.

However, there is a catch!find

Quite frankly, the scrolls have more resemblance with a cigarette bud than a roll of papyrus.

[Example img\_name](https://preview.redd.it/77ir7zz984ta1.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=91f3bbd6283d73bb64c366358aa2732a85363a0b)

Herculaneum Scroll

Looking at the image above, it is needless to say that simply unrolling them is not really an option.

In the 17 hundreds, an Italian monk painstakingly tried to unroll some of the scrolls over several decades. The result was mostly papyrus confetti. He managed to uncover a few intact fragments that had philosophical texts written in Greek on them.

This is obviously not scalable and would destroy most of the texts. However, if we could read the scrolls this would more than double the amount of text that was handed down to us from the Greek and Roman times. The value of that is obviously hard to overstate!

*But, if we cannot unroll the scrolls, how are we supposed to find what’s written on them?*

**How To Read The Scrolls Without Opening Them**

The Herculaneum scrolls are not the first carbonized scrolls to be found.

In 1970, a number of 2000-year-old scrolls were discovered in the En-Gedi Oasis close to the Dead Sea. With no Italian monks at hand and the foresight that opening the scrolls would destroy them Dr. Seals from the University of Kentucky pioneered a method called *virtual unwrapping.*

It allows us to read the scrolls without opening them.

First, a high-resolution CT scan is created of each scroll. The scan creates digital slices from the scroll. The slices are created lengthwise, similar to how a cucumber is cut. Now, in order to perform the virtual unwrapping a sheet of the scroll is traced along the cross-sections.

[Example img\_name](https://preview.redd.it/3fdm424a84ta1.png?width=945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1ade404ada1a841d024f1eb41d7697b6519d548e)

In the image above, you can see an animation of how this is done cross-section by cross-section until a connected piece of the scroll is extracted. These connected pieces are then virtually flattened in order to read the text (see video below).

[https://scrollprize.org/img/landing/engedi5.webm](https://scrollprize.org/img/landing/engedi5.webm)

*So far so good. Why can we not just do the same with the Scrolls from Herculaneum?*

There are a few challenges with applying this technique to the Herculaneum scrolls. On the one hand, the scrolls are very tightly wrapped and generally in pretty bad shape. On the other hand, the ink in the Herculaneum scrolls is radiolucent. This means that X-rays pass through the ink the same way they pass through the papyrus.

As a result, the ink, in the CT scans, is not visible to the human eye.

But there is good news. It has been shown that neural networks can pick up on subtle patterns in the scans that are created by the ink \[2\]. Next, we will look at how neural networks are being trained on the scans and how to win the price. *Read on!*

**The Challenge of Training On The Fragments**

As mentioned above, a few of the scrolls were unrolled by an exceptionally patient Italian monk.

[Example img\_name](https://preview.redd.it/27vy1n5a84ta1.png?width=485&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=37836b061b12b31f95bbc32134c662aa1f82fb25)

Scroll Fragments With Ink

Some of the resulting fragments have legible ink on them.

So, people created training datasets from them. First, a 4µm 3D X-ray scan was created for the fragments.

Overview Of Data Acquisition Process For Scroll Fragments

The [data paper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/educelab/EduceLab-Scrolls/main/paper/EduceLab-Scrolls.pdf), in which they trained a model on the fragments, reports a pretty low recall (in the 40% range).

However, their approach appears to be quite basic. They formulated the problem as a patch-wise binary classification. So, for each patch, their model predicted ink vs. no ink. Furthermore, the final accuracy might not need to be very high to make the text readable.

Most likely, translating the model to the full scrolls will be a tough nut to crack.

The Two Scrolls To Be Read

Alongside the fragment datasets, we are provided with 8µm 3D X-ray scans of two full scrolls. As a matter of fact, we are only given half of the scan data for each of the two scrolls. The other half is held out as a validation set. Each half-scroll scan consists of 14,000 .tif files with 120MB each. Since each slice is 8µm tall, the scroll half is 11.2cm tall.

The two scrolls need to be virtually unwrapped first.

The software to do the unwrapping is provided. Some manual work is required to get it going, but all the pieces are there. I dearly hope that the challenge attracts many brilliant minds from all over the world!

If you have some time on your hand, or you simply want to make some money to buy a few A100 GPUs go and [check out the challenge](https://scrollprize.org/)!

The best ink detection model gets $100K and whoever is the first to read four separate passages on one of the full scrolls wins $700K. An additional $200K of prices will be announced in the coming months.

Money aside, the thought that some guy or girl with a cup of coffee and a laptop could create a model which unlocks this trove of wisdom makes me excited about the present and the future alike.

What an exciting time for science and humanity!

This week’s story sounds like it was taken straight from a science fiction novel.

The leaders of the Church are shaking in fear because of what AI could bring to light.

Thousands of years ago, a massive volcanic eruption wiped out a monumental city in a matter of hours. Among the thousands of destroyed houses was one very special estate. It belonged to a close relative of the most powerful Kaiser that ever lived.

On his estate was a vast library filled with thousands of papyrus scrolls of unspeakable value.

The scrolls contain texts from long-lost secrets about philosophy, science, and possibly even about the origins of modern religions. When the house was destroyed along with the library, the conditions under the scorching hot lava miraculously preserved the scrolls. Under the stone, the scrolls survived for thousand of years.

The scrolls were discovered but have become so fragile that they cannot be opened anymore without destroying them. So, scientists are using modern particle accelerators and AI to unlock the secrets hidden in them. A price of $1M will go to whoever manages to read the scrolls first.

*Pretty good no?*

The best part about this story is that it is not made up. Okay, I might have been adding some drama in my depiction of church leaders shaking under their cassocks. I am pretty sure they neither know what is going on nor are they reading this newsletter.

In this week's edition, we will look at a spine-tingling story behind the [Vesuvius Challenge](https://scrollprize.org/) and see how computer vision can help to unlock the secrets of the past.

Let’s jump in!

**What Actually Happened**

In 79 AD the Vesuvius volcano erupted and buried the city of Pompeii. What very few people know is that multiple cities were also destroyed in the incident. One of these cities was Herculaneum.

We can think of Herculaneum as the Beverly Hills of Pompeii.

The city was full of marvelous villas and estates. One of the more impressive ones belonged to Caesar’s father-in-law. It goes without saying, the guy was very powerful, well-connected, and super-rich.

[Example img\_name](https://preview.redd.it/qyi0aqh184ta1.png?width=422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0b72163b451c1710646e6d213484366356ac3a2f)

Estate of Caesar’s father-in-law

Inside his estate was a giant library full of scrolls from the Greek and Roman times.

When the villa was destroyed, the heat of the lava carbonized (turning to charcoal without burning) the scrolls. This has preserved them for almost 2000 years. Since the 18th century, different groups tried to dig up the scrolls.

To date, more than 1800 scrolls have been excavated and most-likely there are many more under ground.

Some people speculate that his library might even contain scrolls from the library of Alexandria that burned down a few years before. From these scrolls, we might discover completely new philosophical schools, scientific secrets of the Greeks, and *heck!* maybe drafts of the bible with GPT watermarks on them.

However, there is a catch!find

Quite frankly, the scrolls have more resemblance with a cigarette bud than a roll of papyrus.

[Example img\_name](https://preview.redd.it/kyvsh6m184ta1.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=95593ea7682ef1e04a644933f8c56d9cde93775f)

Herculaneum Scroll

Looking at the image above, it is needless to say that simply unrolling them is not really an option.

In the 17 hundreds, an Italian monk painstakingly tried to unroll some of the scrolls over several decades. The result was mostly papyrus confetti. He managed to uncover a few intact fragments that had philosophical texts written in Greek on them.

This is obviously not scalable and would destroy most of the texts. However, if we could read the scrolls this would more than double the amount of text that was handed down to us from the Greek and Roman times. The value of that is obviously hard to overstate!

*But, if we cannot unroll the scrolls, how are we supposed to find what’s written on them?*

**How To Read The Scrolls Without Opening Them**

The Herculaneum scrolls are not the first carbonized scrolls to be found.

In 1970, a number of 2000-year-old scrolls were discovered in the En-Gedi Oasis close to the Dead Sea. With no Italian monks at hand and the foresight that opening the scrolls would destroy them Dr. Seals from the University of Kentucky pioneered a method called *virtual unwrapping.*

It allows us to read the scrolls without opening them.

First, a high-resolution CT scan is created of each scroll. The scan creates digital slices from the scroll. The slices are created lengthwise, similar to how a cucumber is cut. Now, in order to perform the virtual unwrapping a sheet of the scroll is traced along the cross-sections.

[Example img\_name](https://preview.redd.it/qzkt77q184ta1.png?width=945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8ab4597e27ae12dd2c2cb0cf324a5a01653c6a1a)

In the image above, you can see an animation of how this is done cross-section by cross-section until a connected piece of the scroll is extracted. These connected pieces are then virtually flattened in order to read the text (see video below).

[https://scrollprize.org/img/landing/engedi5.webm](https://scrollprize.org/img/landing/engedi5.webm)

*So far so good. Why can we not just do the same with the Scrolls from Herculaneum?*

There are a few challenges with applying this technique to the Herculaneum scrolls. On the one hand, the scrolls are very tightly wrapped and generally in pretty bad shape. On the other hand, the ink in the Herculaneum scrolls is radiolucent. This means that X-rays pass through the ink the same way they pass through the papyrus.

As a result, the ink, in the CT scans, is not visible to the human eye.

But there is good news. It has been shown that neural networks can pick up on subtle patterns in the scans that are created by the ink \[2\]. Next, we will look at how neural networks are being trained on the scans and how to win the price. *Read on!*

**The Challenge of Training On The Fragments**

As mentioned above, a few of the scrolls were unrolled by an exceptionally patient Italian monk.

[Example img\_name](https://preview.redd.it/96us6ts184ta1.png?width=485&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ccd09f9cb1c69b1fa8dc3b93d78aec0548f5264b)

Scroll Fragments With Ink

Some of the resulting fragments have legible ink on them.

So, people created training datasets from them. First, a 4µm 3D X-ray scan was created for the fragments. Second, an additional infrared image was taken of the scroll fragments to make the ink more visible. Then, the ink on ht IR images was hand-labeled. The labeled images are then aligned with the scans in order to create input and label pairs.

Next, the areas with ink were hand-labeled. Finally, the labeled images were aligned with the scans in order to create input and label pairs.

"I've been doing DS for about 5 years and analytics for another 10 years. I tend to focus on variety of base ML skills which allows me to get jobs in any industry. Previously job descriptions were like X years in ML and python etc.

Now they're like X years in NLP, or X years in CV, or X years with this specific model. I'm noticing different industries have different needs/skills, so even though I meet most of the requirements they're asking for X years in some technique I've never used. And there are A LOT of specific techniques.

For example...

""Hands on experience in most of the following: recommender systems, reinforcement learning, contextual bandits, deep learning, non-linear optimization, learning to rank, ads targeting, etc""

""Exposure to Deep Learning applications and tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe is required""

""Preferred skills: reinforcement learning, linear and non-linear optimization, Spark""

""Survival analysis, time series, GBM, NN, NLP, regularization techniques, Ridge, Lasso, elastic nets""

""Deep learning, graph modeling, collaborative filter, and reinforcement learning""

"" Tensorflow, Tensorflow Recommenders, Pytorch, MXNet, Keras""

""MLFlow, Airflow, Docker, Kubernetes, TFX and experience in Graph database is a Plus""

Feel like I've trapped myself and lost touch with my DS skillset. Considering building portfolio via Kaggle or similar, while job searching. Need advice on how to transition back.**  


Hey all, need some advice.  I'm early into my career, but I'm trying to figure out how to go forward from here.  A little bit of background. I have a BS &amp; MS in essentially information/computer science (not quite as theory/math heavy as CS, more application focused, but I digress), with emphasis in machine learning/AI for business problems. Basically, my knowledge might be more in line with advanced analytics (applying  existing models to new business domains) vs 'data science' (researching/making novel models), although I'm open and willing to be in the math heavy research side if the opportunity presents itself.   


My first work experience was as a data science intern on an internal consulting team were I was helping to build models and solve problems using data from various other teams in the business (where I was hoping to be with my current job). I was there for a year before leaving to try something on the business side of things (big mistake, hated that).  This is the type of work I enjoy doing the most.  


Fast forward a couple internships and I'm at my current job. I've been here for a couple years now (first full time position) as a 'data scientist'. I was here originally as an intern but converted. The original intention of the team, and my role, was to do data science/ML work in the traditional sense. Unfortunately, me and the other data scientists don't do DS work. My role has essentially transformed into a data engineering role, where I handle ETL pipelines for the reports that the BI folks on the team do. This isn't to say that I don't find value in my work and I do use related skills, like SQL. I don't hate it. But, it's frustrating that the one ML project proposal we've come up with keeps getting pushed back.. The 'promise' that was made a couple years ago just isn't happening, and it's impacting my motivation a lot. I think its time to move on.  


But here's my problem. I'm worried that my skillset has moved away from the type of work I want to be doing. I worry that I've locked myself into a data engineering career. This wouldn't be a bad thing if  I was an engineer working directly with ML pipelines. Then I would at least have some exposure. Even though my title and job description *is* that of a 'traditional' data scientist, I have no recent projects to speak on.  My resume isn't as impressive it should be for a data scientist 4 years into their career (counting internships).   


What should I do? I'm scared that the transition back to more explicit DS work will come with a pay cut (going from mid-level position back to entry-level), because  I have no recent projects.

"I am a fourth-year transfer (with an additional year left in school) and have been trying to find internships for anything data related. I have asked before in the data analysis subreddit about my resume but I did not get much feedback. Since I apply to co-op's next semester, I would appreciate any feedback. I don't know what is wrong with my resume (maybe I should not include all these libraries I have worked with and only the significant ones). I also have more projects under my belt (I recently finalized a machine learning project where I implemented a basic binary class. neural network), but I am unsure if that would truly stand out and help. I know my background is more analytics, but I would like more data science-related work. 

Feedback I have received:

\- Remove the school I tranferred from and only include my current one

\- Change Data Research Student to Research Analyst (was part of a research program at my school that connected us with small companies in the area).

I want to start a new project, end-to-end, thinking of using (Excel maybe,) SQL, Python, Power BI. Eventually I like to present the work-in-progress, the difficulties, solutions, and outcomes on a website for prospective employers.

According to a regional economics report, one of the growing sectors in my area is financial special services, mainly Investment Banking, Portfolio Management, but not much hedge funds or trading. As I've always been fascinated about that side of things, I like to give a big wink to them with a finance-related project for all the obvious reasons.

I googled several combinations of keywords that included 'investment banking', 'portfolio management', 'portfolio risk analysis', etc, and only found one dataset that is already cleaned and analyzed and used for their own report as part of an essay. Other things google found were essays and articles of people presumably in the industry or academia doing research.

So Reddit it is ...

1. Can you think of any sources for this kind of datasets? Anonymized but with a significant number of variables and values?

2. If you happen to work in finance, what kind of report/outcome do you like to receive from your analyst/data colleagues? Any advice or pointers are very welcome. I can make 30 formal-looking diagrams in Power BI, but if only two of them are actually valuable, the others are just clutter.

"I'm a Product Analyst, and my product manager wants to improve the metric Time to Value (TTV) (how long it takes for a user to start a process and finish it). Our goal is to lower the TTV for our users.

We are seeing TTV ranges from 2 minutes to 15+ days, and this is not unexpected. It's long tail data, heavily clustered in the 10-20 minutes zone, and then slowly tapering off.  


The mean or median alone doesn't really tell us anything, because the data is so long tailed.

What metric can I use that will show if we are improving? I thought the mode and the interquartile range could work. A decrease in the mode would show that we are decreasing the hump of the tail, and a decrease in the IQR would show that the spread is also decreasing. (I chose the mode because it is typically the smallest value in a left tail distribution; all of the numbers are long decimals, so I'll probably need to round them.)

🔥 We’re thrilled to introduce BastionLab, our simple privacy framework for data science collaboration! To see what remote data exploration looks like when all privacy concerns are automatically handled for you, you can check [our GitHub](https://github.com/mithril-security/bastionlab/) or directly go to our [Quick Tour](https://bastionlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/quick-tour/quick-tour/) tutorial, which is also available on [Colab ](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mithril-security/bastionlab/blob/v0.3.5/docs/docs/quick-tour/quick-tour.ipynb)🔒

# Built for sensitive data collaboration

Collaboration between data owners and data scientists is a big challenge for highly regulated fields like health, finance, or advertising due to security and privacy issues. When collaborating remotely, data owners have to open their whole dataset, often through a Jupyter notebook. This too-broad access creates huge privacy gaps because too many operations are allowed, which enables data scientists to extract information from the remote infrastructure (print the whole database, save the dataset in the weights, etc). 

⚙️ BastionLab solves this problem by providing fine-grained access control. It guarantees data owners that data scientists can only perform privacy-friendly operations on their data and that only anonymized outputs are shared with them.

# How does BastionLab work?

BastionLab makes sure that the data owner’s remote data is never accessed directly by the data scientist. Three main elements ensure this: 

* First, a ‘safe zone’ is defined by the data owner to filter the data scientist’s queries, which enforces control while allowing for interactivity. 
* Second, expressivity is limited. This means that the type of operations that can be executed by the data scientists is restricted to avoid arbitrary code execution. 
* Finally, the data scientist never accesses the dataset locally. They only manipulate a local object that contains metadata to interact with the remotely hosted dataset - and data owners can always see the calls made by that object. 

# Ready to try?

If you like the project, drop a ⭐ on our [GitHub](https://github.com/mithril-security/bastionlab/)! We’re open-source, so it’s a big help \^\^",datascience,2253,308

I am working on a project where health care providers will be collecting data about the patient. The patient is fully aware we are collecting the data as part of the program. My organization is not HIPAA compliment so we need all data de-identified. 


What way can this be done? The offices will be sending me monthly blood pressure updates so they have to be able to look at the chart and be able to determine which patient is which I can’t just number them 1-100 or something.

"It's brutal. When I have used ImportXML the first time, it looked like a miracle! I can retrieve data from external website *AND extract data from HTML in one function call*, wow! Now I am sick of it.

**Custom processing and conversions of data is painful in Google Sheets.** Let's say you want to import just 32.22 number from ""cost: 32.22 USD"" string extracted from some website. It is possible to do it in Google Sheets, with some fiddling around formulas and scratching your head, but obviously it is much easier to accomplish this task Javascript or Python, especially if you have lots and lots of data to cleanup!

**There is no proper launch and cache control in ImportXML.** There is no ""scrape now"" button in your Google Sheet. You can't control how often the ImportXML is triggered (well, unless you are a huge fan of Goole Apps Script!) and if you have many cells populated with importXML, it is very easy to occasionally trigger an avalanche of external http calls when opening and editing your sheet. There are also no caching mechanisms in Google Sheets, so if the last call to ImportXML fails, the cell will get *ERR!* value.

**ImportXML only works with basic websites** (no SPAs rendered in browsers can be scraped this way, any basic web scraping protection or connectivity issue breaks the process, no control over HTTP request geo location, or number of retries)

ImportXML just fails to extract data from a huge amount of websites for me.

I have finally found an alternative solution which I have been using for some time, it's more complicated to start but is just infinitely flexible and it just.. works for web scraping. My recipe consists of two ingredients:

1. Proper automation framework: I choose [Make.com](https://make.com/) because it is essentially a cheaper and more techy Zapier competitor, it is mature, and it works great. Free plan.
2. Web scraping API: I use [ScrapeNinja.net](https://scrapeninja.net/) because it allows to write custom Javascript extractors which allow me to extract any data from infinitely complex HTML of the target website, and convert it into arbitrary JSON structure for later usage. It has free plan. **And it can render SPAs like a real browser.**

I am now using Google Sheets like a plain, stupid database - read data, write data back. No external HTTP calls.

"Hi everyone!

So I have 8 separate spreadsheets, filled up with stock market trading data (backtesting),  and I'm stuck in professionally filtering and comparing the outcomes.  
E.g. in 1 spreadsheet there are data from \~700 trades that have taken place, with 6 diffent criteria noted down for each of them (including date, time, size of the market move etc.) To each of the trades, there are several outcomes percentage wise. (e.g. if it reaches a pre-defined level, I close the trade or if it reaches 1:2 risk reward ratio I close the trade etc.)

I would like to evaulate this data the best way possible. I'd like to see that how each result column depends on each of the criterias.  Basically, I want to compare the % of return based on a lot of existing data to see what aspect can definitely, statistically, produce a profit. 

 E.g. ""some criteria"" if &gt;=x then its 80% going to have a losing result. Alternatively, if &lt;=y then it will have a 60% positive result. 

 TL,DR: I would like to examine how the profitability of trading positions statistically depends on e.g. the size of the marke move, and so on, with 6 different criteria like this. And if this has been calculated, I’d need a summary of them altogether to see, that how each individually calculated and optimized parameter would fit with each other. This would provide me the final product, the best possible outcome from this data.

I tried to evaulate by trial and error, by just filtering them in Excel, then I got into pivot tables, which simplified it a bit, but still a huge amount of work, and just too much possiblities.   
Do you guys have any recommendations in terms of evaulating, or what software to use for this? Maybe Tableau could be better in visualizing the data statisctically, then cutting out the losing trades that way? Any recommendations on how to optimize, and compare the results?

Your help and guidance would be really appreciated!

"I recently started working on a time series prediction and forecasting task, and the dataset that I use contains close to 700 features and only 4 years worth of monthly data points (just 48 samples). Part of my preprocessing workflow will obviously be to remove the multicollinearity. As a first starting point, I considered using the VIF before going onto other methods. After the first tests, I quickly realized that almost all of the features are flagged as highly correlated. I went on to further test this hypothesis by running correlation tests on individual features that got the highest VIF values, and found out that they were not linearly correlated to more than a couple of features.

This outcome led me to the question of whether VIF is dependent on sample size, and if the results would be different with a much larger sample size. I couldn't find any evidence to support this and the next obvious step is to test this hypothesis by recursively reducing a large enough dataset.

I psuedo joined the tech layoff getting put into a free agency to apply anywhere by my company and have been joining the mad job rush getting into things. I thought to share some experiential learning I had going on that roughly equates to normal good practice, but is also a good reminder to always consider ourselves expendable and a free agent regardless of if we're safe or not. I'm getting this quality checked on multiple communities and I'd love to hear your feedback.

1. If your resume stands out, they have a specific need, and you fill it beautifully which you’ll understand based on the job description, you can expect to get through the hiring process quickly.
2. If it’s a not sure, the initial contact and scheduling of the interview will go quickly and the process can be very robust based on the size of the company. Even a small company coming from big names can be concerned about the people brought in.
3. The more towards early venture capital you are, the harder and more specific you can expect the hiring process to be because you’ll need to have a very specific skillset to help bootstrap the employer. If it is something bigger like FAANG, they’ll be more inclusive of different backgrounds and start off on the easier foot with something that would represent a leetcode question .
4. Whoever it is though, they will hug to their process, so just give them the room they need to feel they’re making the right decision as they will do the same for you. Keep applying in the meantime.
5. Move towards the companies/positions that are incredibly fascinated with you as that’s the level you’re probably at for the moment.
6. Understand which interviews you enjoyed the most and prioritize learning in that direction throughout the year as that’s where the next step of your career probably is.
7. See what you could chain into next based on the positions you get and relative volume of demand in the market using job boards like LinkedIn as you start to get a feel for how in demand that job role is.
8. Get a feel too for how this current position prepares you for your next position. Maybe it lets you consolidate 3 resumes down to 1 for instance and be very specific on the skills you prep throughout the year in wait for the new role.
9. At a certain point in the search, you’ll start to notice some leads are consistently souring. Use that understanding to get a sense of how competitive the market is, but also what skills you lack so that you can grab an appropriate position to be successful in the future.
10. Have fun with the process. It can be overall nailbiting a lot of the time, but everyone is working to everyone’s elses’ success. Keep up the momentum, but give each other room!
11. As the leads start to wind down, feel free to get started closing the gap towards the next role. The quicker you grow, the faster they grow and the quicker the project will be done. Things might get a bit rambunctious, but focus on getting to the finish line and adding the completed tasks to a brag doc.
12. You can have all the education in the world on a specific topic and the recruiters will still turn you down for unknown reasons once talking with a hiring manager. Once you get good, partner up with people in teams and push your skills to the next level, thereby alleviating any concerns had on their end.

I would really like a to get a job in data analytics or data science. I’m aware that a degree makes getting a job in that area 100x more easy and I’m willing to go back to school. I have two options right now: I can go to a Purdue sister school, Purdue Fort Wayne, and do in person classes. Or I can do an online bachelors program at IUPUI, a sister school of Indiana University. Housing would not be an issue for either since I live 10-15 minutes from Purdue Fort Wayne and iupui classes are online. Price is similar.

I’m just worried about workplaces not valuing an online degree.

Any input is appreciated.

Thanks in advance.",datascience,1066,194

"Hi everyone, as the title says I am planning to attend and begin UNC Charlotte's Master's in Data Science and Business Analytics and wanted to get a second opinion from people in industry/students. I  graduated with a biology degree in 2021 and since have dived into coding, math, stats since school and want to further my education. I understand that OMSA has a program for 10k but I want a program in person where I can develop connections at the same time. UNCC's program is slightly over 20k and has many connections with industries in the area and host a myriad of seminars, career fairs, and have a great placement rate. Now my question is, would the time investment be worth it to develop connections and deepen my analytical/technical skills at this program vs working my way up as an analyst?

"Working on a time series classification project. I’m going through the sktime library and reading each and every classifiers summary about the method that’s being used under the hood to fit the model, and I’m basing my choices based on how long it may take to train. For example, half of them are distance based (nearest neighbors) methods, and I know for my dataset a distance matrix (and most data in general) just takes a stupid amount of time to compute. Or some do Shapelet discovery, which is traversing the entire subsequence space and computing distances between the subsequence and original series and using those subsequences (shapelets) to predict, which also, takes a long time.

"Hello scientists,

I have some basic data, more like a very basic personal project, and I want to find a way how to visualize it in a nice way. A three circle Venn diagram is not enough, I will need something like a ""oval flower model"" with multiple intertwining and mutually intersecting fields.

The basic tools online and in Excel seem not to be self adjusting based on how much text I want to put into the image (some fields require a lot of it). So I would like to find an online tool which can create a beautiful visual representation for me and which would automatically adjust the size of the diagram fields. 

I am not proficient yet in advanced tools or programming languages like R or Python, so I would like something simple.

I am sure such a thing exist, I just suck a bit at finding it. It seems very easy, something that would look like this but that would automatically adjust the size and shape:

My intent is to go with a data split of 70:15:15 (train/test/holdout) and do an EDA on the data. I want to check how meaningful certain features are, whether they correlate etc.. Then I'll drop features and/or engineer derived features and see how they cluster and whether PCA will result in any insight re feature engineering?   


Since I'll likely use the insight of the PCA to inform the feature engineering, I think a holdout data set is necessary - at least in theory. However, since anomalies are both \_anomalous\_ and sparse, I'm not really sure whether this can actually be practically implemented.

Currently I am researching extreme learning machines, and - after I calculated the beta weights  - I would like to optimize the alpha weights (similarly with the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse) in order to receive better accuracy.  
During this backward calculation, I use the inverse of the previously applied activation function. In case of the inverse sigmoid and tanh (logit and arctan), I receive NaN values, although with the inverse leaky ReLU, on certain datasets, the method yields better accuracy.

"I’m 27 - through my 20s I’ve had some industry changes, education pivots etc - but I finally found a bit of a niche in data science, if you consider data viz a vertical. 

I was hired as a data viz specialist this summer - finally fully getting away from my biz management background. I’m also a CS grad student (on and off), which also contributes to imposter syndrome (I struggle a bit). Anyways, in many ways, I’m still sort of entry level. 

I work in an agile environment with 3-4 data engineers, my boss is an ex sr analyst/engineer, and some salesforce folks. I just feel…stupid. They make these amazing things with data happen in queries, I just make it pretty dashboards and do some side admin work (notifications/comms). I get good feedback, I think I’m liked, and I’m the only data viz person remaining - I was an internal hire and we’ve tried 3 consultants to assist with data viz but were all canned for poor performance. So in a way, I am finding some stride in that I’m *the* person creating part of the experience for the end user. 

But then sometimes I feel capped. I’m not in SQL a lot. I have experience in Data Viz tools (Tableau, Power BI), but am mostly using a Salesforce equivalent. I do some light pseudo-SAQL coding (which I’m not sure is even great) but that’s it. I mean, a lot of my queries are sort of trial and error to get the desired output. It works, I’m not always fully sure why, I’m sure there’s a way to do what I did in 5 less lines. But I don’t know. I also manage the downstream dataflows, but that’s mostly simple joins and reporting to DE when a job fails. 

In some ways I’m learning…I think. But in others, I’m wondering if there’s growth in data viz. I love it. But it feels like I’m taking all the true work of the smart people and just doing the work they don’t have bandwidth too. Kind of like a designer and not a core data person. I could be wrong. Most of the time my boss has most of the ideas and I use them. I go back to other dashboards and tweak what worked there and move it to mine. I just feel dumb.

And then, what prompted this, is when I worked with the DE team the last few weeks. My only “data viz” equivalent is another consultant with like, 20 years experience, but he hates data viz and mostly hides in Salesforce tools and data management work. But even then, he knows a lot. We sync with data engineering on topics like data masking, AWS keys, object creation, schemas in tables…I’m just so lost. It’s above me. Sometimes I try to absorb as much as I can, others I just need not to learn something and overwhelm myself because I’m at peak capacity myself. 

But we talk, they solve it. I didn’t even fully understand what buckets are in AWS - dev, prod, etc. I feel like I’m quiet in meetings and let the smart people talk it out. Because I’m out of SQL, I feel like that skill isn’t as sharp. And we’re hiring another core analyst, so my focus remains on viz. and don’t get me wrong - I love viz. I think it’s sort of my niche - but I do want opportunity to do more, earn more, and more so contribute to my team and be useful. Right now it just feels like I’m running alongside everyone trying to keep up, but not fully “getting” these concepts of data work we’re doing. And obviously I don’t want to ask and sound stupid during meetings. And my boss has limited bandwidth and can’t just teach me things with all this time he doesn’t have. Even I. SQL, I do have the database but have no idea what to do with it. I was told to look into ROW_NUMBER, NOLOCK, etc - but still feel dumbfounded by simple concepts. 

This is mostly a vent. I just feel like a kinda not smart person benefitting from the work of great people, and being unable to understand these concepts. Yes I’m new in a way, but I want to do more and help more. And I’m just unsure what I’m doing is right or if I get all this feedback because honestly, the only skill I feel I have is just following direction",datascience,3946,755

"Hi,

First off, I am not here to downplay the effectiveness of resumes.

When you are looking for a good job, it helps to have a resume that helps you stand out from the competition. In fact, here is a [good Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z90g0x/i_am_an_experienced_resume_writer_and_editor_and/) around using resumes to stand out from your competiton here.

When used correctly, you can use **BOTH your Linkedin profile and your standout resume** to get the tech job that you want.

Much like your resume, your goal is to **create a great first impression** so that you can get the right tech job that you want.

**WHY HAVE an OPTIMIZED LINKEDIN PROFILE ANYWAY?**

* **Linkedin has consistently 1.6 billion in monthly visitor traffic.** (that is a lot of people who are actively searching for business and professional connections. This means that you have a lot of people that you can reach out for the right tech job.)
* **Linkedin has 810 registered global members** (In a global job marketplace where remote working is a growing mainstay trend, your job employment options are wider with more managers reporting higher productivity levels among remote workers.)
* **According to** [**Linkedin**](https://news.linkedin.com/about-us#Statistics)**, 49 million use the platform to search for jobs** (This means with an optimized Linkedin profile, you can stand out from your growing competition - especially if you plan to work remotely in the first place.)

**What I am here to discuss here is how you can:**

1. optimize your Linkedin profile to generate active conversations
2. use your optimized Linkedin profile to generate more Connections with your Linkedin profile.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here are a few things that you need to keep in mind when:**

**OPTIMIZING YOUR LINKEDIN PROFILE:**

* **Create a strong Linkedin facial picture** (Use a very identifable facial picture where people can clearly see your picture. Smile, by the way. Your facial picture should be showing how you look like as a person.)
* **Create a clear banner picture** (You are missing out on a large opportunity to drive traffic to your Linkedin profile. Your Linkedin banner picture is one of the first thing that your potential employers or recruiters will see/present to your prosepective employers. Use your Linkedin banner picture to showcase specifically how you can be of a service. You can also use your banner picture to have more people message you by placing a call-to-action (""CTA"") so that people immediately know how to reach you.)
* **Know who your Linkedin profile is for.** (One reason that it takes longer to get the tech job that you want is because your Linkedin profile is usually broad and is treated like a record. With enough research, you can effectively target the right individual and tailor your Linkedin profile to that ""Persona"". This way, you can clearly communicate how you are of service to your potential employers.)
* **Keep all information relevant when it comes to appealing to right end viewer** (You don't need to list EVERYTHING but instead you can list relevant information that your end viewer wants to know. Today, within a hybrid/remote work environment, most employers are shifting their employees to focus on more higher-value work. Tailor your information to clearly address the proposed higher-value responsibilities that your employer is looking for. You can even create new information that tailors to the concerns that your potential employers has when it comes to hiring you directly.)
* **Organize your Linkedin profile around generating conversions** (This is key but the main point is that you use your Linkedin profile to generate more Connections - which in turn generates more conversions. Conversions are people resp)
* **Create external/native media that showcases your expertise** (People are lazy: you can exploit that from your competition. Experiment with Polls - so your content spreads to ""new"" Connections. Use short-form video with an in-video call-to-actions (share this video). When your potential employers see your video on your Linkedin profile, you can stand apart from your competition.)

&amp;#x200B;

*and* **GROWING YOUR LINKEDIN CONNECTIONS:**

* **Focus on generating conversations that transcend off on Linkedin** (While Linkedin is a great place for you to meet people, you want to move as many as those relationships to direct e-mail. Think of Linkedin as the public meeting place but the direct e-mail is the place that you can use to connect more intimately with your professional. This way, your messages are not absorbed into a sea of other messages. Plus, you have a direct relationship with your potential employer.)
* **Build an internal CRM** (There are tools that you can use to track your list of CRM. If money is tight, use AirTable to create a kanban board around a sales process so you can actively track where each employer is at when it comes to hiring you directly. With a CRM, you can actively prioritze which potential employer that you want to put more focus upon versus others. This also hastens the time between jobs or even finding a better fulfilling tech job overall.)
* **Actively reach out to your List of Connections** (You have Linkedin Connections. You should use them...not like a sociopath. However, you need to be starting Active Conversations. It may take a week or two to get a response but you need to build a habit of reaching out to your Connections (and new Connections) on a daily basis so that you always have fresh opportunities that you can always take advantage.)
* **Linkedin Sales Navigator is your best friend** (You can use Linkedin Sales Navigator to target the most active accounts on Linkedin. This hastens the response times that you will receive from potential Linkedin profiles. Plus, you have a rosterof new leads that you can use to generate new leads.)
* **Always grow your Linkedin Connections** (Shit happens. Always grow your Linkedin Connections so that way, you can always have opportunities on standby. Keep posting media that showcases your expertise. This way, you can grow your Linkedin Connections and have a rainy jar when your job ""unexpectedly"" goes sour: *a manager asks you to work in the office when you are super-productive in your own home*.)

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to comment. I will readily respond.

"This is the question which is among roughly 20 others to be graded for a second interview. 

**2.** **In order to increase close rate, you instruct sales reps that, after each meeting, they should either (a) have a next-meeting scheduled or (b) call accounts every day.** **You** **decide** **to** **build** **a** **report** **to** **measure** **if** **reps** **are** **doing** **that.** **Mock** **up** **what the report should look like.** **You can use fake data.** 

 I have completed all the other questions besides this one because for one, I don't think the correlation of calling every day would net a positive result like the question insinuates and two, I don't think it's enough information in the first place to make a meaningful report.

" I have tabular data where each group of 100 rows represents a deployment of a specific geometry that has certain features measured. For example, I have 10000 deployments stored in a column called ""Dep,"" which ranges from 1 to 1000. When fitting this data to an xgboost model, the model may mistakenly assume that the deployment numbers have an ordering relationship (e.g., that deployment 1 is less than deployment 2, which is less than deployment 3, and so on). However, this is not the case because all deployments are independent of each other. On the other hand, if I remove the ""Dep"" column, the model will not be able to differentiate between the different deployment groups and their unique geometries.

I got the idea of one hot encoding of the column dep, but it's useless as the training dataset has 7000 deployments while the test dataset has 3000. If I do a one hot encoding, the shapes will not match (along with a slew of other issues). Better think of another approach.

"I’m adapting one of my old algorithms where adds features based on some weight vector and then recalculates a score to see if adding the new feature helps.  

I’m testing it on the iris dataset with 996 noise features and noticed that sometimes it adds around 50-90 noise features because it increases the accuracy.  Less features is more in this case so I’m wondering if there is any penalty I can add that is on the same scale as the scoring metric (eg accuracy for classification which ranges from [0,1] or negative mean squared error which goes from (-inf,0]) but based on the number of features.  Basically saying “is it really worth it to add this feature?”

I know there’s L1 and L2 penalty for linear models but I don’t think that applies here because if o square the number of features or something it will be largely out of scale with the scoring metric (eg adding a feature has a positive change in accuracy of 0.3 so let’s keep it, another feature only adds to the accuracy by 0.001 so let’s not add it). 

Any brainstorming on this would be very helpful so don’t hesitate. I’m currently stuck on this idea.",datascience,1119,202

I have come to a point now where I will have to lean into one or the other to grow in my career. My options:

1. My current job is pretty relaxed, I am working flexible hours but will not grow if I don't do more strategic planning and content creation. I can do courses, mentoring, etc. to learn more about storytelling, writing documents and improve my strategic thinking.

Would it help if I have some software engineering experience (I did an 8 month internship in firmware test engineering this year, which was mostly low-level C programming), or is that not really relevant, since statistical coding is pretty different from software engineering?

"For context, I posted last night asking whether it's worth learning SQL if I'm only doing DS as a hobby, and a lot of people said there's more I can do if I know SQL.  So I'm willing to give it a try, but I don't really know where to start.  I mean, there are plenty of tutorials available online, but I learn best from doing an actual project and looking stuff up as I go (I'm not interested in doing a course on Udemy or the like because I hate learning from recorded lectures -- especially since I'm doing this for fun, because I like data science, I don't want to force myself to watch a bunch of lectures).  So I was thinking I'd find an actual database online with an interesting dataset, pick some project I'd like to do with it, and then find tutorials in to how to use SQL to extract, clean, and manipulate data, and use them as I go.  That's pretty much how I've been learning statistical coding in both R and Python.  

The problem is, when I Googled variations of ""publicly available databases"", I just found freely available data_sets_, the same type of stuff I'd find if I Googled ""free datasets"".  I figure there have to be actual databases available to the public, because otherwise how would anyone self-teach SQL, but clearly I'm using the wrong search terms to find them. 

Part of the problem is perhaps that I haven't had a course on what databases even are really -- I just completed a DS minor, but all the projects and assignments we did involved using R and/or Python to read in data from a CSV or XLXS file. I have a general idea of what databases are and I figured I'd learn more about them as I started using SQL (I learned about data cleaning and manipulation almost entirely from doing projects in R) but right now I'm very much a newbie to databases.  

Does anyone have any suggestions for the search terms I should be using to find a database I can use for learning?  Or links to any websites with freely available data stored in a database?",datascience,1974,367

We know that matrices in linear algebra are structures that allow us to represent transformations, operators, systems of linear equations, among others.

And we know that matrices in computer science (or as such those used in data science) are structures that allow us to analyze information.

My question is:
- aren't data science matrices the same as linear algebra matrices? 
- don't data structures have a geometrical representation?

I am looking for feedback on an idea I'm working on.

It's a desktop application that will allow you to open the most common data file formats (CSV, JSON, Excel, Avro, Parquet etc.) and explore their contents in a nice table, you'll be able to search, filter, sort, group rows or run custom SQL.

From the table view you can also create charts and export them as images, or export a subset of the data as another data format, so you can effectively convert between data formats too.

In the future I might add some data cleansing features but for now it's just viewing / analyzing.

So one day I'm just sitting around in the office when I overhear one of my colleagues say ""\[something\] Python \[something something\]"", which was surprising to me because our work doesn't involve any programming. Although I didn't know him that well, I thought well this could be my opportunity. After he finishes talking on the phone I tell him ""excuse me, but did I hear you say Python?"". We start talking and it turns out a few people in the department are trying to work on a project and they want to use Python. So I go ahead and meet with them. It turns out they were looking for someone with programming skills who can implement their ideas. I have a few discussions with them, they send me a sample of the data, and I show them what I can do with it. They got excited so we spent a few weeks working on this project together. We finally get to a stage where the project is presentable.

Am I right in this feeling that the basic ML tools are enough, or is there real application for neural networks and advanced ML tools for business data analysis?",datascience,769,132

"For context, so far I've done small stuff, exploring data sets from Kaggle and data I've generated myself (e.g. analysing letter frequency of some documents I'd written) and applying different ML algorithms and statistical tests and visualization techniques using library functions in R and Python.  

I'm an EE major but I added on a data science minor last year because of how much I like statistics (and because I wanted an excuse to take courses involving any sort of programming) and I found that I really enjoy the statical coding we used in my DS courses to analyze and visualize data.  I finished all the courses required for the minor, so I want to continue doing learning more of it on my own, just doing personal projects.  

My question is whether, just being a hobbyist (and so not having access to any huge databases like companies might use to store customer data or the like), is there any point to trying to teach myself SQL?

"Hi team,

I’m feeling a bit lost. Apologies ahead of time for the novel, I’m just hoping I can spark some good discussion, and maybe gain some motivation.

I’ve been working as a contractor for a small/medium-sized staffing firm for 10 years, on contract as a help desk/customer service manager at a large multi-national organization. Out of necessity, I started getting into data analysis, hit a wall with Excel, and decided to get a MS in business analytics. Now, equipped with passing knowledge of SQL and Python, growing intermediate R skills, some database management, expert Excel skills, and more than anything, a drive to make the business better, I’m trying to shift my position off of this contract, and more into my company’s headquarters operations as a lead data… person. Nobody else at my company does what I do, and it’s still very much an unknown as to what I’ll contribute.

I’m constantly feeling unsure of myself, my skills, my ability to drive meaningful change in my company. There’s no centralized data anything, every contract is on their own, and HQ uses myriad siloed softwares that don’t integrate. There is no standardization. The most data-savvy colleagues I’m working with are very impressed with xlookups.

Has anyone been in this position? I find myself getting stuck by thinking about this role in waaaay too grand terms.. like I know what I think the systems should look like eventually, but I’m still barely at step 1. I keep getting asked to fix Excel formulas, when I know a solid R system might be 1000x more efficient. I haven’t had the chance yet to use anything more advanced beyond regular R Studio, so I don’t feel like I can justify purchasing Connect. Or whatever might help integrate the code with the deliverables. I’m still not even really sure how to progress from the visualization stage of data science to the modeling/production stage… there’s just no existing infrastructure, and I have no examples to build off.

"Probably a dumb question, but in school we only worked with datasets that had an  end results (e.g. we already knew what customers churned,etc), so I want to make sure I’m doing this right.

Let’s say I have 500,000 customers, 150,000 of whom have purchased a specific product. I now want to find which of the other 350;000 customers would be most likely to buy the product. 

If I were to use xgboost or random forest, would I approach it like this.

1. Randomly pull a train/test group of 200,000:size (or another size), we’ll call it dataset 1,
2. Create a hold out group(dataset 2)  using the rest of the customers.
3. Create model using data set 1 (train, test, split)
4. Once model is good enough, run it on the holdout set.
5. Use predictions to decide who to market campaign to.

I guess in my head, I’m thinking a good model should only predict who has already purchased the product. Would the holdout group be comprised of customers who have never purchase it. Or, like in class, should I include people who have bought the product to check for accuracy. 

I also thought about creating a cluster model to see which non product customers are grouped with the product customers.

"\*\* Market Research for an idea \*\*  
Over the last 5 years I have worked for several companies as an Analytics Engineer (implementing tracking and tagging solutions) and Data Manager. 

My job normally included getting a picture of online and offline data and unite them. 

In each company I started auditing the different data and marketing platforms to understand the data structure, naming conventions and platform integration status. 

All of the companies I worked for had a big problem with old, cluttered and incorrect data.   
In one company we ripped out the complete tagging and tracking system and set up a brand new tag management system and platform end points (mainly Google Analytics, Databricks and some other platforms)  


In the other company I spent a very long time manually auditing the data and raising bug ticket after bug ticket to align data schema, streamline data endpoints and fix duplicated or broken properties. 

Even not being involved in one new website feature can mean derailing all naming conventions for that feature and headaches for any analysts or scientists who need to use that data further.   
I feel like this is a recurring theme in companies. Over time you get clutter or old data concepts that are no longer used due to team. focus or platform changes.   
I am currently investigating an automatic auditing solution for different data platforms, starting with the biggest, to quickly and easily get a view of what is currently collected and how.   
After this I would like to come up with automated platform enhancing tips based on best practices for that specific business (you are not using this GA feature, enabling this would give you x etc.)

You could also define conversion steps for different products/ areas of the website and see if the tracking is coherent or needs adjusting, simplifying the whole naming convention of your website tracking to keep it easy for analysts. 

 I would like to discuss with you if you also experience this problem in your companies and if it involves a lot of manual work that could benefit from an automated tool like the one described.

I have three coworkers  - Bob, Jack, and Jill. 

Bob spends most of his day asking people what they are working on where he then asks more questions with the intent of finding something he knows about so he can talk about it and essentially try to tell the other person how to do their job. Bob did this to me once and I told them to fuck off - they don't do it to me any more but plenty of people entertain Bob.

Now Jack. I was recently put on a project with Jack and Jill and I work with Jack on other projects. Jack and Jill were writing code that is planned to be put into production and quite frankly the code base was shit but I never told them. I was asked to come in and extend the capabilities of their code base meanwhile Jack has done basically nothing since I have started on the project and Jill essentially only attends the meetings now. 

Today I was asking Jack about a portion of his code that gives inconsistent output for the same input and I asked him if knew why the API did this. Jacks response was basically telling me to add an if statement to his code to rerun a rejected request. More or less he dodged the actual question and averted to telling me to do some basic ass thing which I don't need him to tell me how to do; I'm quite confident that just about anyone with a pulse could come up with the same solution but it doesn't actually address the underlying problem and thus might not even be a solution at all. 

This interaction more or less summarizes the sentiment of my interactions with Jack.  Anytime I do good work to improve the code base he tries to claim credit for it in meetings and any time I ask him questions about the code he wrote his responses are deflective and generally shift into him trying to tell me how to code. I don't know if he is purposely being an ass or if he's just that aloof but it's really starting to get on my nerves. 

Now to Jill, Jill has two things going for her which are a language barrier and a superiority complex. We will be sitting in our weekly team meeting that she participates in where I give an outline of what I have accomplished, what I am still working on, where my work is going, and how it fits into the overall process map (which didn't exist so I made one). No shit, at the end of every meeting Jill basically tells me to do what I already said I was going to do except she does so explicitly outlining most of the things I already talked about where she does this with some new words for a twist. Maybe this is where the language barrier is a thing - I'm not sure but it's definitely annoying. 

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind that Jill and Jack are basically the same level as me, we have the same roles / responsibilities only they have masters degrees and less than 1 years work experience and I have a bachelors degree with a couple of years of work experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I've been on the project - Jill has basically done nothing but attend meetings and Jack, though he has done a slight amount of coding, has pretty much done the same. It's at the point where I don't even understand why our project lead keeps inviting them to the meetings / they keep showing up but that get's outside the intent of this post. 

&amp;#x200B;

To extend this further, I have noticed that in my org it's particularly common for the Data Scientists to walk around telling people what to do and that most of the work is probably done by 40% of the people where many of them just keep to themself.

"Currently I work as a senior data scientist at a tech firm (non FAANG). Previously I used to work as an data science manager at a non tech (big bank). 

My ideal career aim is to get into FAANG data manager role. There are many reasons I want to get into a managerial route but one of the key reasons is I'm tired of being an IC, leading multiple workstreams alone AND doing the hands on keyboard work whose complexity half of the stakeholders don't even understand. Plus ICs at tech have zero power/say

I joined my new role a few months ago for two reasons a) Opens doors to tech especially FAANG b) more opportunities to laterally move in data science adjacent roles like strategy or product manager
The con is I'm a small cog in a big machine and org is so huge it's impossible to create impact/grow or be visible.

Pro is : I noted in my interview process, interviewers are highly biased towards tech/non tech. If you're coming from non tech background it's harder to break into tech plus they'll definitely down level you

What's the best optimized path to get to my career goal?
Is it easier to slog as an IC for 2-3 years in tech and eventually get to manager or am I better off going back to my analytics manager role gaining more experience for a few years and then trying to make the switch

"Hey guys,

I'm a recent graduate from a Data Science Masters program with a few previous years experience in data analyst roles.  I'm on the job market but things are slow for now and I have a lot of time on my hands.  I'm thinking of developing my skills set and thinking Deep Learning (maybe through [deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai)) might be a good next step, but I'm not sure whether there might be other, better things to learn first as I have heard on this subreddit that most people actually do not use neural nets much on a regular basis at all.

I have a career as an analyst and have generally been more interested in delivering insights and driving business decisions than ML.  Over my graduate career I developed strong fundamentals in statistics, some ML, experimentation and linear models.  The linear models course I took at the end of school got me very interested in predictive modeling in particular.  I see a lot of ML-focused roles asking for experience with Keras and Tensorflow, and think it may be time to pick up deep learning.  Funny - I never pictured myself getting into ML and I think my heart is still in analytics and product, but it could really widen the range of jobs I am applying to if I start picking it up.

"Hi All,  


I am currently working as a data analyst in a consulting firm, I have been there for 1 year, and it's my first tech job. But I am finding I am struggling on the job, I have extremely low confidence in my coding abilities and skills. My background is an undergraduate degree in Business and a master's in Sociology/Data Analytics and I am in my late twenties.  


In my current project, I am one of the analysts, and I just find that all the coding I do is pull reports and edit code that others have written when maintaining our platform. I was given one project that went nowhere and other than that my supervisor/seniors on the team don't trust me with any other work. I have been given good feedback in performance reviews but I feel like I'm underperforming and I have no confidence in my skills. I have no drive to finish tasks and that makes me even more inefficient since I won't be given anything else to do or no feedback or advice. The platform we are working on is currently being migrated to another team which doesn't help with my lack of motivation and doesn't push others to give me more work to develop code.

I'm at a loss whether this just isn't the career path for me, I am terrible at reading others code for editing purposes, I don't have much experience coding and feel I'm slow at it, and I don't have a particularly strong aptitude for maths. In my masters, I worked my ass off to pass the statistics modules. 

I was considering studying for a postgraduate diploma to swap either into another area of CS like security networking, and testing or learn more about cloud architecture and move to data engineering. I am worried I'll have the same issues in those fields.

I have considered moving jobs but I feel like I have nothing to offer. I actually feel less confident in my abilities than when I got this job since my Python programming has gotten rusty and on paper, I look more impressive than I am. And I'm worried I'll have the same issues in my next role.

"I'm kind of in a difficult situation and considering leaving my job. I'm a AI student and was offered this job after I did a project with them for my bachelor in June. 

I was hired as a junior ML engineer, but sometimes I feel like they hired me because they want to do something with ML, but they actually don't know what. 

For example, I have worked on a project for about 2 months and turns out, my supervisor was working on some code with the exact same functionality without telling me. His code, a rule-based system, was deployed and mine not. Turns out that he still made me write the code because he thought I could use it to label the data to use it for a supervised ML project, before actually thinking if it would be a task that is even suitable for supervised ML. 

We have to give a presentation this Thursday on our goals for the future and my supervisor had to think for more than a week before being able to write down some goals. 

I feel like they should have hired a senior because my supervisor only started working 3 months before I took up the project in June and did not actually study AI of DS. 

It feels kind of useless to work on tasks without having a vision of what we are working towards. Besides that, I don't like the company culture.

We aim to develop a data-centric, experimental tool that models the ML pipeline to organize workflows, building off the Agile methodology of software development. Our tool will allow ML engineers to design, track, and manage custom pipelines, data flows, and models all on the cloud. Below of a list of some features we plan to introduce:  

**Integrations**: Include a host of integrations to MLOps tools (KubeFlow, MLFlow, etc), cloud computing services (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), source code management (Github, Bitbucket)  

**Iterations**: Allow multiple iterations within pipelines, and separate each iteration by various steps in the ML pipeline (business understanding, data visualization, data pre-processing, model training, model testing, model optimization, and deployment). Include a Kanban chart per each part of the pipeline  

**Callbacks**: The ability to request to go back to previous stages of the AI pipeline to either improve previous steps (like data preprocessing or model training/development/designing) or request other teams to improve previous steps (we refer to this as callbacks)  

**Storage**: A cloud storage solution to store ML models, datasets, or any other metrics/graphs/whatever ML engineers want to store.  

**Sketchpad**: A sketchpad to design data flows and ML models, and link them to code  Private Assignment: The ability to individually/uniquely assign tasks to different roles in a team, and the ability to be able to privately and specifically send vital information to specific people. for example, the pm could only send the data set to the data engineer, the preprocessed data to an ML engineer (potentially added on top of all this is a differential privacy layer), and send the packaged model to an integration engineer.  

**Chat**: A chat/communication platform to interact w/ your team  Quantitative Focus: ML is quantitative. The client wants QUANTITATIVE results. Hence, the epic should be emphasized on being quantitative rather than qualitative.  

**Experiments**: We redefine “sprints” as “experiments.” We make two changes to sprints. First, we DO NOT have any deadlines on any sprints. This is to not put the engineer under pressure. Secondly, instead of asking “what”, we ask “how” when asked to describe the experiment. This provides a heavily qualitative focus on the experiments, with a focus on function rather than immediate deliverability as in software engineering.  

We would appreciate any feedback on our platform, as well as any problems you guys are facing in data science/ML project management.  

Thanks a bunch in advance!",datascience,2733,413

"Continuing a previous blog post analyzing errors in popular LLM benchmarks (post on Google’s GoEmotions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vye69k/30_of_googles_reddit_emotions_dataset_is/)) — I analyzed HellaSwag and found 36% contains errors.

  
For example, here’s a prompt and set of possible completions from the dataset. Which completion do you think is most appropriate? See if you can figure it out through the haze of typos and generally non-sensical writing.

"I'm just wondering if you fine folks have any recommendations for a beginner in DS who's looking to polish their resume with some freelance work on platforms like Upwork.

Bit of background: I'm an electrical engineer by trade and worked in sensor and robotics development for about four years. I also have quite a bit of knowledge in Python and CV/ML libraries, but have only ever used them internally (never actually delivered a software solution to another team). In that time, I also did an MBA so I'd say my business knowledge is okay.

I decided I wanted to switch out of ""regular"" engineering and more into ML/ data engineering and am now doing a master's in engineering to specialize in ML/CV. Also did Google's Coursera course on data analytics, so I have some knowledge of SQL, Tableau, etc...

I guess my main question is, given that I have never actually worked for a software team or in a formal DS position, can anyone slip me any pointers on other things I should know/practice or courses I should take before putting myself out there for freelance work? Obviously, at some point, I need to just jump in, but I'd like to avoid mistakes that are obvious to people in the industry but not so much to newcomers.",datascience,1223,217

By analyzing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) data with a framework that combines exploratory, explanatory and predictive analyses, the authors were able to identify patterns and structures that could be used to detect the long-term effects of the virus. The findings suggest that graph analytics can provide more accurate and comprehensive insights compared to traditional methods and have important implications for efforts to detect, track and combat pandemics like COVID-19.

"Hello guys, I'm a DS at a Fintech company and I'm facing a particular problem that I need some advice.

The Marketing team of our company wants to work on a Cross Selling Model. But, they are not interested in New Users, they want to know who are the users that we currently have that did not Cross Sell into another product but are more likely to do it.

So, in my mind, I was prepared to work on New Users, the population of our model would be New Onboardings of Product A, and our target would be the Users that Cross Sell to Product B in a time frame since they acquire Product A. But they are not interested in this.

So base on the requirements of the problems, it seems more likely a Look Alike model, do you agree with that? 

I was thinking also on giving them our train score predictions, in my mind, what they were asking for are the False Positives, I mean, when the model predicts that the user will cross sell but it was a mistake.

Any advice of how to tackle the problem would be appreciated.

Last week I came across a very interesting law called the Benford's Law, which states that if you select any real-life dataset, and separate the leading digits from all the records of a numeric column — the most frequently occurring digit will always be 1. Infact, 30% of all the leading digits will be 1.

"I am about to finish my Master's degree in Data Science and have two job offers. I am not sure which offer I should accept with a view to the long-term future and would appreciate some suggestions.

1. Fortune 100 Company. The job title is Data Scientist, but it is more of a data analyst role. I probably won't be working on hard data science problems and won't be using the latest state of the art. I will also be the only data scientist in the team, but I will work closely with executives.

2. Small and relatively unknown startup. I will probably work on more typical data science problems and research state of the art methods. I would work together with other data scientists.

For each client, my task is to find a ""smarter"" way to display this CTA to readers than merely showing it on every page view, sort of a question of figuring out the ""when"" for each reader so as to improve conversion rate. I have full clickstream data of every reader's page visit along with dwell time, maximum scroll depth, referrer, type of device, etc. as well as every time a reader submits a newsletter signup form. 

What kinds of models would you recommend looking into? Would you consider plain predictive ML or something powered by causal influence (which I've seen is in vogue these days)?

"BLUF: no degree but heaps of knowledge and experience in engineering, cybersecurity, and DS/ML.

I'm a seasoned cybersecurity analyst (threat hunter) and have been focusing on applied statistics, data science, and machine learning (classical and deep learning) for the past few years. I also am a full-stack engineer, which helps when creating tools and analytics. I've taught myself statistics and probability, linear algebra, and a little calculus, as it's necessary for fully grasping a lot of DS/ML frameworks and methodologies.

I've really struggled with imposter syndrome since I've started trying to break into data science and machine learning. It seems almost everyone has a masters (or two) or a PhD. Education-wise, I have enough credits for an Associates but didn't get the degree. I was working on a BS at the time, so getting the AS on paper didn't seem important. I'm extremely outclassed when it comes to degrees. However, what I do have is a considerable amount of domain knowledge, the ability and dedication to learn new topics, and a decent amount of data science and machine learning knowledge.

I've performed time series analysis (ARIMA, STL decomp, P/ACF plots, forecasts), built predictive models and classifiers (kernalized SVM,  decision trees, XGBoost/Random Forest), and have played around with GMMs, latent profile/class analysis, ICA and PCA, and t-SNE. I've also built a CNN and have built and used an autoencoder for anomaly detection. I mention all of that to demonstrate that I've gained a small amount of knowledge and experience and to get feedback on how that might stack up against other data scientists or other candidates trying to break into the field. I don't know how to showcase these particular KSAs without an advanced degree backing it up. I was able to pass both the Python and Machine Learning assessments on LinkedIn. The Python one had some linear algebra and data science questions, which surprised me. The Machine Learning assessment was a huge boost in confidence as an affirmation of what I've learned and how far I've come. It's laughable in the comparison and I would never bring it up in an interview, add it to my resume, or use it as a true credential, but it helped me out spiritually.

I'm not wanting to step away from cybersecurity, rather I'd like to bring DS/ML knowledge to bear on the longstanding problems within the industry, namely modernizing defender and detection capabilities. Right now, I largely work alone within a larger analyst community. I occasionally link up with some of the data scientists and machine learning engineers with the organization but I'd like to work closer. Trying to find that path really reveals my limited qualifications. Most positions have degree requirements that are at the grad school level and I can't compete in that arena. Could I make up for the lack of degree with certifications? Preferably ones that don't themselves have degree requirements (eg, aCAP requires a masters). If so, what certs would you recommend?

Hey everyone, 

Thank you for stopping by and reading the post. A little background of me; I’ve recently graduated from Dental Hygiene School, and have a B.A. in Biology. 

I’ve had a rough start in my hygiene career, but thankfully landed at a great clinic along an amazing team. 

Dental Hygiene takes a huge toll on the body overtime, and I may have a rheumatoid condition. It’s put a few things in perspective, and I might wanna veer away from the career and move towards something else.

I’ve studied biology and in the midst I’ve taken classes for Stats and Calculus and really enjoyed it.

"Dear fellow data scientists

I'm in the blessed situation that my Data Science training has paid off and i now have some job offers to chose from. I write in hopes of getting some advice from some of you pros in regards which job offers i should accept. Mostly because the jobs seems to be in different ""clusters"" under the term Data Science. Its essentially a choice between:

1. Traditional Data-analysis in a scrum environment. Lots of data cleaning and exploratory analysis. Low pay, medium IT-skill.

2. Data-analysis oriented towards Business Intelligence including automation/ETL, SQL, PowerBI and more socially interactive in conveying results and helping non-analyst coworkers. Medium pay but higher potential, low-medium IT skill.

3. Straight DS including working in an Agile/Scrum environment, mainly doing analyst + machine learning to find solutions to a multitude of services in the public county. Low pay, high IT skill.

And then without job offers but still relevant there the 4th path: More SWE focused paths which includes more coding, having to either simple front end duties or learn about unit testing, data structures/algorithms and other languages but Python (C, java or the like). MLOps og MLE futures. Medium pay, high IT skill. Much for me to learn.

Since i don't have any experience yet i'm not sure which direction i personally prefer. I think i'm best off just getting any experience. But already now i have the choice to impact my DS career by which job i accept. However i think the business job sounds good because i will learn basic ETL, automation, more like all-around IT skills, but i'm also afraid of it not being technically advanced enough and i'll be stuck as a dashboard and simple descriptive statistics monkey that will always be a business guy. Then theres the more ""IT solid"" jobs that has a better IT infrastructure already, more technical coworkers, agile procedures, but whats the future in this? I will just stand on what others have built perhaps and not advance in regards to social aspects or domain knowledge.

So i was wondering if you pros knows anything about these domains? Whats the most solid choice? What would you do if you just started out? I know its kinda hard to answer without knowing personal preferences but its still a choice to be made and any wisdom is appreciated!

Also if people is interested in hearing how i got good enough to land basic data analysis jobs just message me. It was mainly dataquest + minors in math/cs and experience teaching statistics.",datascience,2532,425

"TLDR: Need to recommend online courses to users. Recommending approach is unspecified. Don't know how the data should look. Don't know how to train the model. Don't know how to deploy this for production. 

Background: I have done work in NLP, images, numerical datasets. I have trained and deployed models to my REST API. I'm aware of CRISP-DM (Collect, clean, train, test, evaluate, deploy, monitor, etc). I'm just completely unsure on how to deal with this project. 

================================================================================

Greetings, I've just recently received a project from one of my clients in which they would like to develop a recommender system. The company is related to education. 

Thus, they would like to have a system that can recommended a list of courses to the user based on their input/personality/characteristics/etc. 

I've never worked on this kind of system so I'm a bit lost. What I have gathered is, in recommender systems, they are a few ways to go about this. 

The first approach that I've seen is called Content-based filtering. The second would be collaborative filtering. 

Content-based filtering is simply suggesting items that are similar to the items that the user is fond of. For instance, I like Apple juice, so it is possible that I might like Orange juice as well. (Hopefully my understanding is correct).

For collaborative filtering on the other hand, the suggestions are not based on the content/items, but rather on how similar the users are among each other. For instance, I like Apple juice, and a friend of my likes Apple and Orange juice. So, since we have some similarity with one another, he suggests me to have Orange juice. So, I'm guessing this is how collaborative filtering works. 

What I'm having trouble right now is, how am I supposed to go about this for recommending online courses? If I were to go with collaborative filtering, I would need a lot of users in my system. So, let's assume that there's not much traffic in the system as of now. This would result in inaccurate recommendations. 

If I were to go with content-based filtering, I would need the user to enter a few courses that they have enrolled before. I think..   


Both of these approaches have a similar problem which is called ""cold-start problem"". In which, I would need some input from them, in order to make some ""viable"" recommendations.

What if I were to make a survey, and based on their input, I would recommend them a list of courses based on what they chose? If I were to choose this approach, I can't see how the data would look like, or even how I'm supposed to train the model for recommending. On top of that, I don't see how I'm going to export the model and apply it to a REST API. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do let me know your thoughts regarding these approaches as well as my understanding on this concept. Thank you so much in advance. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.  
If you have any resources that could assist me, do let me know. So far, I've seen examples of, entering a name of a course, and then recommending similar courses based on their name/descriptions.",datascience,3120,527

So I have this dataset where I’ve extracted all the words that have a shared meaning, and how many different languages that they have a shared meaning accross. I’ve then taken two lists of words with their affect value (-1 to 1) and arousal value same scale. And extracted all the word pairs with a value. 

So I extracted the top and bottom quartiles of the most and least colexified words across languages. 

I was told that a t-test would be a good test for my hypothesis but I can’t exactly figure out how to do that?  Would I be doing a single t-test and using what mean? The mean for the whole set or just the sample? 
Or a paired t-test? 
There’s 18000 words in the top quartile, and I did a linear regression and it has a small positive Pearson r value for affect and small negative r for arousal which fits my theory.

"Hello everyone,

I found the posts of other users who successfully transitioned into data science to be very helpful and encouraging in dealing with my own feelings of rejection and self doubt. 

I just accepted a position as an econometrician in advertising tech, without any relevant real world experience (internships, jobs, etc.).

Here is the summary of my experience.

\- Went back to undergrad for two semesters to brush up on calculus, econometrics, and statistics

\- That got me into a fairly well reputed STEM Econ MA program.

\- I took elective coursework in statistical learning, game theory, Python/SQL/GCP for big data, and of course, lots of work in R in econometrics.

\- I did several ML/DS projects to reinforce my skills and learn independently, and competed on Kaggle

\- I completed the IBM deep learning with PyTorch cert on coursera, and posted two tutorials on how to build neural nets for simple binary classification and convolutional networks for multi-class classification

\- I made three resumes for specific fields (tech, consulting, and general)

Over the course of 2.5 months: 

I made 143 job applications 

Had 11 phone screens

Had 4 technical assessments

Received 2 offers

On it's face, it seems like a numbers game, but that really doesn't capture how involved the process was. With each rejection, I resolved to be better.

\- Was the code in my repos filled with detailed comments?... No, I fixed that

\- Was my github organized, professional, with detailed readmes?.. No, I fixed that

\- Was I blindly applying? Yes, so I started reaching out to other data scientists for advice and referrals

\- Was my resume showing projects that highlight desired skillsets? No.. you get the picture.

All in, this took me about two years to go from someone with no coding, math, or statistics background to break into the field. 

If I can do it, you can probably do this faster and better... but this was just my experience.

Best of luck, and happy hunting!",datascience,1994,333
"Hey there, 

I currently work as an accountant who has been cursed with being assigned what I’ll call the “pedestrian” data science tasks of my department. I currently am hating my life not because of the relatively easy technical asks, but because of the impasse we’ve hit surrounding data controls. 

Being accounting related, all of the data flows to the general ledger as a journal entry. Generally speaking, the more subledger detail encoded into each journal entry, the more well constructed the G/L is. However, the company I am working for refuses to change how they record and enter JEs, and especially are not willing to discuss implementing data controls. Their current process is to post 1 entry per country for each applicable transaction type. Without getting too deep into accounting, this would be like if you received your credit card bill as a lump sum and you had to try and figure out separately which specific items composed the total from your receipts, but none of your receipts said what they were for or where the transaction took place...and you had receipts from 47 countries in different currencies where the currency isn’t even listed...I digress 

The resulting data set is ambiguous. The desired work around (which I vocally do not support) is to use static tables with the hypothesized transaction drivers loaded and pray the results align to the actual results. The massive requirement for manual maintenance of the static tables makes operating the model entirely redundant, and the results that it can produce are not at all something I’m comfortable presenting. 

I am starting to worry that this data science ask is going to ruin my accounting career. What would you guys do to solve this and deliver a usable model? How do you data scientists push for better data when you’re being pelted with the unrealistic asks for the quality of data provided? Especially when no one will grant you agency in the underlying processes.

"Greetings. I am a 24 year old male and I graduated in 2020, my field was Industrial engineering. After graduating, covid had hit every industry and it was very difficult time to get a job. During that time I started teaching math online and it paid well, even after getting a job in a textile industry, my math venture was paying me 5x more and that too by sitting at home and working on a laptop so I left my job and continued it full time. Now I feel like my growth has stopped and I am worried about the future. Also I have 2-4 hours of spare time that zi can invest in learning something. So, upon some research my university is offering 2 years masters in data science and AI (with some additional courses to study for me as well because I am basically switching my field). So, I want some career guidance, what should I opt from these two. Obviously it would be a new field for me if I choose either of the two, I just want to invest my time in something that has a broader scops and can help me in getting remote work.

I graduated recently with a relevant master's degree and have experience in picking up on problem statements up until delivering the best performing model and a presentation for my results but have no experience and getting from there to actually deploying the model.

Currently, I am working as a junior alone, and have been in charge of multiple projects one of which has to move to deployment through AWS.

I've been connected with other Data Scientists internally, none of which was either involved with AWS or willing to help (WTF?). Thus, I am left alone to figure out how to do it as everyone expects that from me, I  raised my troubles to my manager, he is really trying but honestly no luck in finding a combo of a person who knows and wants to help out yet.

I am more than happy to get on it alone, however before starting on how to do something I have to learn what it is. Thus, I look for steps I should take to move from my academically written code to the place  I get to have it deployed in AWS. Below are some questions I have, ignore any if they sound weird as it is the confused me who probably got something wrong

* Should I use pipelines? An example?
* Break the code into multiple files per part (e.g. a file for data cleaning and another for modeling)
   * What should the insides of the file be, a function?
* Should I create python packages for my functions?

"Hi, I’ve run into a situation at my company and was wondering what all the smart people on here thought would be a good approach. 

My company released a new feature for an app that was awarded on a first-come-first-serve basis (the user had to pay 5000 of the in-app currency to unlock it). We allowed only 1,000 users to “purchase” this feature and it sold out in 2 days (there are roughly 80,000 active users a week). 

My job is to measure the impact this feature has on user behaviour. Naturally, there is a ton of bias in the users that have purchased this feature (accounts are older, users are more active on specific parts of the app, different demographics than our general user demo, etc). The core way I know about to test impact of a feature is through AB testing, but since this was not set up as an AB test, I need to explore alternative options. 

So far what I’ve done is use propensity matching on the “treatment” group vs all of the other users that don’t have access to this feature to try and find a comparable control group. For practical reasons, I propensity matched on about 8 different variables. Since there are many more variables that I can’t guarantee are equally distributed between the two groups, I decided to do a difference-in-difference test to evaluate the lift. 

Additionally, when the 1,000 spots sold out, a lot of users joined a wait list for the next time this feature could be purchased. I did a difference-in-difference (DID) test using this group as well. When comparing the DID from the wait list users vs the propensity matched users, I’m getting different results. One says something like an improvement of 10% while the other shows a decrease of 8%. 

Does what I did make sense? Is there a better way to approach this?

I appreciate all of your opinions on this :)",datascience,1815,325

The purpose of these projects is to practice my Data Science skills and create a journey for myself and others into data science while creating interesting projects. This is week 8 of my learning journey!!.

In this project, we analyse How and why some universities excel in south-east Asia and QS Ranking as a system as a whole.

Here are some Key findings.

1. QS ranking although very reputed, they have a long way to go before properly ranking all universities comprehensively.
2. Some universities lose rank because they are specialist universities and we must take that into consideration when comparing with other universities.
3. International outlook and students play a very important role in the university ranking and therefore must be an integral part of the university and maybe they should be given more opportunities to make them join the university in the first place.
4. Japan leads most of the South Asian universities, but Malaysian universities have seen a promising rise over the past 5 years and may have a great outlook moving forward

Now, in the 2nd round they said you'll have to take another assessment test.( I had no idea what it was about)

So I started taking exams and now it was on full screen so cannot use a calculator or anything and the exam turned out to be 60 questions in 60 minutes and consisted of 3 parts: logical reasoning, data interpretation/aptitude, English.

So I started with English and data interpretation because obviously I cannot do without using a calculator or pen paper ( i tried and was looking for paper but it immediately spotted that i was looking away from the screen and gave me a warning) so it was the only option.

I'm not native English speaker but still decent with questions but here are a few questions where I need to answer from comprehension ( time taking at least for slow readers like me) 

So I could not complete the entire exam in time and now I think this was a little bit unfair from them

So the question is should I contact an HR and try and talk to them about what happened?
OR
Forgot about it ? this is too desperate a move (Which I am)


I'm feeling pathetic after this got rejected by a good company in the final round prior to this and later got almost scammed by a fake company this is the 3rd one and I messed up big time.

"I have no prior knowledge in data science, but have a pretty typical data science project I would like to have done. I am unsure whether its feasible to learn to do this myself, or I am better off outsourcing it to someone via upwork (or something)

**THE PROJECT**
I would like to create a stock market database from which I can filter stocks according to specific criterias. Ie.:

* Print a list of all stocks which gapped up 4%, or more, in the last 5 years
* Print a list of all stocks which positive earnings surprise in the last 5 years
* Of the stocks with positive earnings surprise what was the avrage gain?

**THE SOLUTION**
This should be doable using a stock market api (ie. finanicalmodelingprep), excel, streamlit (or many other tools). My problem is that I would be starting from scratch.. Would this be doable as a weekend, or two, project?

Alternatively, if I were to outsource it on fiverr; what key elements would I have to describe in order for a data scientist to produce a good results?",datascience,1009,183

"Greetings, need some guidance or mentorship to kickstart my career once again. Yet another mediocre as per Indian society just having high-end aspirations. People started saying my life is in a complicated state, and I agree as well. I did Maths as my UG and later decided some Post Graduation (did in entrepreneurship and marketing) would help to reach where I aspire to be but didn't go that way, got a decent job as an ERP consultant with 4.2LPA as a fresher but found that is also a very long typical journey so decided to learn #DataScience (thought UG and PG would add up as maths and domain knowledge for DS). but no money to opt for big courses so decided to learn self. But it isn't as motivating as the regular structured way of learning since the path and results are unforeseeable. Now after spending (wasted) 7 months (learnt 20% of the course may be) after leaving my job. No idea what else to do to move forward in life. 

So my questions are, 

1. I am ready to continue my self-learning journey if companies or market demand accept, by looking at my skill and online projects, also will it be stressful even to get called for an interview?  Is it okay to do self-learning, moving forward with a DataCamp subscription and other free learning portals? 

 2. Or if companies prefer some degree or course, should I opt for some courses (3-4L) 6/12 months where they allow ISA (Income sharing agreement) payment mode which is paying after getting placed? (Financial constraints won't allow for paying upfront). Already I got an education loan to repay but I am fine to add more debt if it pays well.

3. Any new ideas? Confused. No idea what to do...

"Hello all,

I've recently started my first job after graduating from my bachelors in chemistry. One of the things I'm going to do is analyse the data from our mobile measuring systems which measures the composition and calorific value of green gas/biogas/biomethane. A measurement is done every 6 minutes for 4 weeks and we analyse 10-30 components, depending on the type of gas, so that's quite a bit of data (to me at least). The software that comes with the hardware automatically writes all the data in a .txt file which we copy and put in Excel. After this everything is manually checked and graphs are manually made after which a report is manually written.

I know this can be done way easier and faster but I'm not sure what skills I need to learn so I thought who to better ask than the experts themselves. I've started learning python but I'm not sure where to go from there. Preferably I would like to use a dashboard that shows the most important data and updates every 6 minutes (every measurement).

"Hi,

I am currently a software engineer/developer. But am thinking about changing careers to either Data Science or Business and Finance.

I am trying to get a feel for what Data Science will be like compared to what I am doing right now. The things that have me thinking about changing are the unpredictable long hours and the amount of troubleshooting and debugging that goes into just making sure an app is going to work.

I do not mind taking work home once in awhile. But between all of the languages (C#, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, etc.) and the frameworks (.NET, BootStrap, Vue.JS, etc.) I find myself having to study CONTATNLY! I would rather be able to have to study a core of tools/concepts that will go a long way for a long time, instead of having to study every-time I am off of the clock or on the weekends.

The next item is how every-time I build something, it never works the first time and I have to build it again. I find myself saying, ""Why isn't this working?"" more times than I would like to. (One software architect I talked to said that's why he transitioned from development). And then doing this on top of a deadline just magnifies the stress.

I have a feeling that you will probably tell me, ""Dude...that's how it is in data science too!"" But I just need to ask if anybody who has made this transition can tell me what it was really like and if it sounds like a good fit for me.

"While I know this questions has been asked many times, most of the answers are usually generic stuff like “I code and use statistics to solve problems”. I know what the basic meaning of data science is. I mean more *actual examples* of the kind of problems you solve.

This question comes because I became interested in Data Science because of the many applications I see (self driving cars, image recognition softwares, virtual assistants like Siri, recommendation engines, etc).

But since I got my first job as a Data Scientist (I graduated a year ago in Maths), my experience has been… underwhelming. It’s mostly just basic coding in Python and running SQL queries. It’s not even real Data Science as it’s just programming. 

I know it also has to do with me living in a fairly small city, and the market in Spain being shit (I plan to move elsewhere anyway). But I’m afraid that these fancy jobs might just be a tiny percentage and most jobs are just Python programming with the fancy “data science” title attached to it because it sounds more attractive.

"To me, there's a growing discrepancy between how the applications of AI are becoming more and more impressive and interesting and how actually working with AI is getting more and more tedious, at least in the industry.

A few years ago, tackling a new project was exciting. I had to wrangle the data, read a bunch of papers to find the best model, possibly implement it myself if no public implementation existed, train it, test it, etc. But the field is getting increasingly dependent on immense models and huge datasets that only big tech companies can dream of training. In the past year, I have worked mostly with NLP. I haven't had to touch tensorflow/keras/pytorch ONCE. All I do is reuse existing models through an API and possibly engineer the input a little bit to get the most out of it. Even fine tuning has become too resource dependent to realistically tackle most of the time.

The papers I've read recently are also pretty repetitive, most of them can be summed up as Google/Facebook/Amazon announcing ""So, we took a transformer, added 50 billion parameters and a new dataset and the results improved! Surprise!"".

So, what do I do all day if I'm not actually manipulating data and models? Well, I have become a software developer by another name. The thing is: I don't particularly enjoy software engineering. I know that, to some people, coding is like puzzle solving. But to me, it's like a frustrating never ending game of whack-a-mole. I precisely went for a data scientist role because I didn't want to be stuck in boring discussions about which function of which library of which framework will satisfy the biggest amount of programming principles. Unfortunately, that's pretty much all I do these days.

I even changed jobs recently because I felt like I had just become a glorified software developer. But guess what: Meet the new job, same as the old job. The only data sciency part here is the one time a month I actually send an API request to a model I didn't even train.

I know software development has always been part of the job, but it went from something I did while waiting for my model to give results to something I do all the time. I legit think somebody who knows how to code but has never touched a statistics book or trained a model could do my job.

I don't know what to do. I have a master's degree but no PHD, so I don't think moving from industry to research would be easy for me. Big tech companies don't have much of a presence where I live, and the application process is soul crushing. I almost want to move to education, because it would allow me to stay up to date with the field while sharing my passion for AI with other people, but I don't have any education-related diploma that would allow me to actually teach (plus, the most interesting work would be uni professor, but since I'm not a researcher that's almost impossible).

There are two types of people I have to deal with one side thinks neural network models can do anything and everything, and the other (mostly the older folks) do not believe or trust the prediction results and ultimately push back. 

Any advice on how to deal with this situation? Or is anyone working in Medtech research please give me some suggestions. Thank you",datascience,645,108

"Hi all,

I am currently a freshie in my first analytics role out of college (graduated this past May) and I am actively exploring various career paths, both traditional and non-traditional.

Having followed a few ""data science"" influencers on LinkedIn for quite some time now, I've noticed a common theme that organizations are in need of data management that understands modern data infrastructures better. And after taking a look at Data Management as well as DAMA's (a unified global data management community that sets standards essentially) book on Data Management best current practices...I've come to decide that a career in Data Management might be for me. There seems to be a good balance between traditional management responsibilities with top-down leadership of all data-related activities within an organization. ([This Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_management) provides a decent overview of the field and DAMA's DMBOK outlines.) A few questions for those familiar with the field:

1. What would be a career path for those in a Data Manager role? It seems that Data Governance and CDO are common exit-roles, but what possibility of moving into a traditional analytics manager role might exist?
2. Why is the pay for this role not as relatively high as other data career roles? I see the national average is 80-90k/yr, which is decent, but not as much as a data analytics manager, let alone a data science management position.

"Hi Everyone,

 I hope you are doing fine. I am currently in the process of designing a comparative analysis that shall contrast the differences between various forecasting methods. I am trying to predict stock returns by running a cross-sectional regression using various factor inputs. However, no matter what I do, each and every regression receives a negative out-of-sample r2 score.

I checked everything and could not find any error in my code. I tried manipulating the data but even that did not help improve the r2 values.

Here is my code to run the regression:

    from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso
    from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
    from sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNet
    
    
    def prediction_function(df, regmodel, window, n_factors, alpha):

                X_test = df[factor_list].iloc[i].copy()
                X_test = np.array(X_test)
    
                X_test = np.reshape(X_test, (1,-1))
                X_test = pd.DataFrame(X_test)
                if regmodel=='OLS':
    
                    lm = LinearRegression()
                    ols = lm.fit(X_train,Y_train)
                    predictions = ols.predict(X_test)
                    predictions = pd.DataFrame(predictions)
                    predicted_df = pd.concat([predicted_df,predictions],axis=0)
                elif regmodel == 'Lasso':
    
                    model = Lasso(alpha = alpha)
                    model = model.fit(X_train,Y_train)
                    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
                    predictions = pd.DataFrame(predictions)
    
                    predicted_df = pd.concat([predicted_df,predictions],axis=0)
    
                elif regmodel=='Ridge':
    
                    model = Ridge(alpha = alpha)
                    model = model.fit(X_train,Y_train)
                    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
                    predictions = pd.DataFrame(predictions)
                    predicted_df = pd.concat([predicted_df,predictions],axis=0)
    
                elif regmodel=='EN':
                    model = ElasticNet(alpha = alpha, l1_ratio =0.3)

            predicted_df = pd.concat([date_df,predicted_df],axis=1, ignore_index=True)
            return predicted_df

and here I apply the function:

    from tqdm import tqdm
    tqdm.pandas()
    
    OLS_predictions = regression_df.groupby('permno').progress_apply(lambda x: prediction_function(x,'OLS',window, n_factors, None))
    
    OLS_predictions.reset_index(inplace=True)
    OLS_predictions = OLS_predictions.drop(OLS_predictions.columns[1],axis=1)
    OLS_predictions.columns.values[1] = 'date'
    OLS_predictions.columns.values[2] = 'OLS_pred'
    OLS_predictions.reset_index(inplace=True)
    
    stock_data = regression_df.groupby('permno').apply(lambda x: x.iloc[window:])
    stock_data = stock_data.reset_index(drop=True)
    OLS_results = stock_data.loc[:,['permno','date', 'fwd_daily_exret']]
    OLS_results
    
    OLS_results = pd.merge(OLS_results,OLS_predictions, how='left', on=['permno','date']) 
    display(OLS_results)
    
    OLS_metrics = calculate_metrics_linear(OLS_results, 'fwd_daily_exret','OLS_pred', 'OLS_metrics', n_factors)
    display(OLS_metrics)

the calculation for the r2 is done using:

    def calculate_metrics_linear(df, true_variable_name, predicted_variable_name, dataframe_name, len_factors):
        r2= r2_score(df[true_variable_name],df[predicted_variable_name])
        r2_adj = 1-(1-r2)*(len(df[predicted_variable_name])-1)/((len(df[predicted_variable_name])-len_factors-1))
        MSE = mean_squared_error(df[true_variable_name],df[predicted_variable_name])
        rss = np.sum((df[predicted_variable_name]-df[true_variable_name])**2)
    
        df_metrics =  pd.DataFrame(data=[r2,r2_adj,MSE, rss])
        df_metrics=df_metrics.rename(index={0:'r2',1:'r2_adj', 2:'MSE', 3:'RSS'},columns={0:dataframe_name})
        return df_metrics
    

The r2 score I receive are:

OLS: -0.14

Lasso: -0.23

Ridge: -0.24

&amp;#x200B;

But I always end up having negative r2 scores and I can not find the error. Did someone else ever experience something similar? Or am I having a mistake somewhere?

* [CSLR](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-fourth-Thomas-Cormen/dp/026204630X/): Classic. But even further above my level than Sedgewick's. Also, no Python.
* [*Grokking Algorithms*](https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious-ebook/dp/B09781V6F7)*:* For beginners. Examples in Python. Doesn't have a ton of coverage. But I have to start somewhere. Maybe combine this with CodeWars, LeetCode, etc.?
* [*Elements of Programming Interviews in Python*](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Python-Insiders/dp/1537713949/): Another good resource for slamming problems. Being that it's a book, I'm guessing it provides a little more conceptual context than LeetCode
* [*Data Structures and Algorithms in Java*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0672324539): Obviously, this doesn't use Python and that's my issue with it. But I'm including it here as the Java equivalent of what I'm looking for. It has absolutely glowing reviews.

- Model training (on cloud providers)
- Sharing results with stakeholders
- Batch Inference (dumped to a data warehouse or object store typically, deployed to cloud)
- API deployment (if needed, most of the time I try to make it a batch solution)

"I've seen lots of articles and the like explaining binary cross entropy and they all seem to miss a pretty obvious (imo) interpretation.. so I feel like I'm going mad. 

so here it is

if you have a set Y of observed binary events and a set Z predictions then the binary cross entropy is basically a modified version of the probability of observing Y given Z is the true distribution for Y. 

that modification is taking the negative average log. my assumption is that you take the log just to keep the loss linear for minimization functions and negative since you want to minimize it. 

example: 
Y = [1,0]
Z = [0.8,0.1]

P(Y|Z) = 0.8 * (1-0.1)

log probs = LN(0.8 * 0.9) = ln(0.8) + ln(0.9) 

then just take the negative average.

am I going mad?

"The long and short of my story is - I’m in my late 20’s, got my undergrad in business, previously worked in Biz Management and found my way into Data Science through a Data Viz job. I’m getting my Computer Science (DS focus) degree online as well. It’s been a hard transition. One I enjoy, but don’t feel like I’m skilled at.

This job’s my first technical job of any sort. I work in agile development sprints, correspond with data engineers, and have tools like SQL/Salesforce/AWS that I’m in and out of. I love the job - but I know I’m not skilled. I have basic SQL experience, but nothing like my boss. She’s super technical, can edit and workshop queries just by guessing and moving stuff around. I have practiced a bit but am so overwhelmed by all my company data. I’m exposed to a lot more data. I struggle with exploratory analysis. 

I think I’m analytically minded but not confident. When we brainstorm ideas for visuals…a lot of the time I just say Net Demand of X. Not percentages, different types of values and equations. I do well when told what to do, but am bad at coming up with my own ideas. Again..:overwhelmed. I think I’m not confident. And look this isn’t some intensive engineering job, it’s a lot of dashboarding, but this project is used company-wide and I’m the sole rep on it. There’s a lot of pressure: my pay went up 50k to 75k and I feel intense pressure to be worth it. 

We had our first dashboard review today. I worked for hours on it. It’s on a Salesforce Tableau vs regular Tableau, so lots of limitations and a weird JSON coding element. It’s been an adjustment for me. Instead of SQL there’s “SAQL.” Instead of learning the language ive just been using the widget tools in the app, which is easier but limiting. Either way, I worked on the dashboard maybe for 4 days during the work day, and I spent tons of free time on it - probably until 8am. And after receiving feedback, we still need lots of changes. 

I get that’s part of it. My boss said it was nice progress and that I have “good instincts.” What made me nervous however was, we tag team this visualization aspect with a company that provides us with contractors. The woman I was working with doesn’t have much businesses sense. Her contributions were really rough around the edges. My boss had a hard time confining her disbelief in how bad it was on call. And the week prior, the same employee presented another dashboard with similar negative feedback.

Anyways, my boss pings me and says she spoke with the contractor’s boss (who also works for that company) and she was removed from the team today. Just like that. I know my boss said it wasn’t on me but she’s basically like “this isn’t working out with X, she’s out.” It was just so sudden. She is a contractor from an external company, and I’m internal …as well as an internal hire. But it happened so fast. Two bad dashboards and she’s out. It made me worry my job isn’t secure? But it could be totally different. My boss isn’t in love with that contractor company, but they did find a replacement whos supposedly more tenured on the platform. 

Anyways, I’m more or less venting. But I’m scared I won’t pick this up fast enough? I spend a lot of time in widgets. I feel like I’m not asking these smart analyst kinds of questions. Just…the exploratory analysis doesn’t come to me by my own volition. It can come up in conversation, but when I’m alone and trying to think, I feel so overwhelmed and I blank. Nothing comes, just a blank. And then I worry I’ll get fired. My boss is very kind. But she’s very smart and this job pays 75k…which isn’t a ton in DS, but it’s a ton to me. My old boss was very lax. My new one is kind but there’s expectations, which I love. My old job was miserable and monotonous, I’d be done by noon. But I’m starting to fear I’ll never be good at SQL, learning in the Salesforce app takes too long so I won’t find it, and I won’t ask enough good questions to become an analyst one day. Plus…I love data viz too. I want to be good at this. I got hired based off my reporting efforts at my old job. But I feel like I’m
Not good enough.

I know this is needlessly long and I’m sorry. I’m really stressed. I work super late to refine things on the dashboard. But I don’t feel smart, I don’t feel technical and I’m overall a bit scared of my job security - even though I’ve been told nothing to suggest that. Just seeing someone else go scares me. Plus now I’m taking her work. But we’ll see. Just any advice is helpful

"So I have an interview tomorrow for a programmer analyst position at my current company. The position is using SAS, SQL, Excel and such to create solutions for internal clients. So I’ll work a lot with the clients which I have experience with. 

The issue is I don’t want to short change myself by asking for too little. I’ll have my Master’s in Data Science in the Spring so that’ll open up a lot of opportunity. I’d like to get around 90,000 but I don’t know if that’s possible. From what I’ve seen, the average salary for a programmer analyst is between 65k and 75k.

Takeaway:
I think for young people like me who have been begging most of our lives for job to pay the rent, when we have the stability of a good job, we have the option of walking away from new jobs since there will always be other opportunities. So, the question really isn't what is the maximum I should ask for to get the best salary, but what is the minimum that I would do the job for?

"Hey All, 

TLDR: what are your thoughts on Columbias QMSS masters program as opposed to their Data Analytics bootcamp? What are pros/cons to be thinking about?

Curious as I am about in the process of applying for the QMSS program at Columbia but keep getting adds for different boot camps that are making me rethink my options.

Background: 

Currently work in structured finance, my first ft job from undergrad and about a year in. Its not for me, great people, and I have a lot of internship experience in finance but it isnt for me nor what I can see myself happy with in a few years. During undergrad (econP) I had to do a thesis and that was my favorite time - finding data, cleaning it, see if it tells a story, and write a research paper. I also have been seeing better reviews in terms of pay and WLB which I value. I am also reaching out to Columbia to learn as much as I can, but I am still aware they will always try to sell me on something so I take their information with a grain of salt as of now.

**QMSS:** A decent amount of my undergrad classmates have gone through this program and they said it was rigorus but they loved it and job prospects are good. They also say Columbia did a good job at helping them finance the 1year program at around $75k. They, like I did, came from an econ background and said the coding was hard but manageable and they thought it was worth it. After talking to my professors who helped my classmates, they also think it would be a good fit for me. 

**Bootcamp:** Its a shorter period of time, and cheaper. I value the holistic education of a masters, but taking on so much debt and leaving my finance job for a completely new field is daunting. With a Bootcamp, its feasible to do it part-time and keep my current finance job. I would still have an income as I take class, and there would not me a financial constraint when I complete it and look for new work as I would have my finance job as a safety net. 

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts on a Bootcamp as opposed to a masters? Are there other pro/cons I should be thinking about? In the job world, how do people view a bootcamp vs masters?

"Hey there, 

We wanted to share a library that we've been working on for a while. It's called [`OcrPy`](https://github.com/maxent-ai/ocrpy) - a Python library for doing OCR++. 

At its core the library aims to unify a multitude of OCR systems (commercial &amp; open-source) and provides a consistent and unified interface, along with a lot of additional functionalities that are usually really useful in practice - such as identifying the type of documents, the different types of layout's they come in etc and in turn processing them in different approaches.

Once you parse these docs, it also lets you index and enable searching over these collections via semantic search. 

with that said, here are the links to the python library, documentation &amp; tutorials.

1. Github: https://github.com/maxent-ai/ocrpy
2. Documentation: https://maxentlabs.com/ocrpy
3. Overview: https://maxentlabs.com/ocrpy/overview
4. Tutorial: https://maxentlabs.com/ocrpy/examples

Tl;dr of the library:

![](https://maxentlabs.com/ocrpy/_images/ocrpy-workflow.png)

- It supports various types of ocr cloud backends like AWS-textract, google-cloud-vision, azure-document-recognition, etc &amp; open-source OCR backends like - tesseract. 
- It supports async processing of docs on various kinds of cloud storage like s3, GCS, azure storage, etc.
- Due to the abstraction of various types of these cloud/open-source OCR parser backends &amp; storage backends - if required you can just switch from one ocr vendor to the other without any changes to the codebase or the output formats.
- You can also index and search over the parsed docs - currently we support indexing it to Elastisearch and OpenSearch backends. 
- In case you are interested in processing different types of docs with different types of parsers you can automatically identify the type of the doc and then use the appropriate parser (or write your own custom parser) - this is useful if you want to for instance use some deep learning model for handwritten docs or say table extraction etc.. vs using off-the-shelf OCR for regular docs. 
- Document type classification and layout parsing within the docs is built on top of Huggingface transformers - as such you can easily swap out and play with different types of models or add your own custom models into the pipeline as well.",datascience,2327,352

* Developing these sensor systems/analyzing the 6+ gigabytes of data I've collected has me using R/Python/SQL/Linux, and various dashboard programs. I don't consider myself a ""pro"" in any of these areas but I haven't run into a problem I couldn't solve utilizing them. 
* I've grown to really really really enjoy working with these types of tools and want to get paid to do it. 
* I also have about 2 years at an environmental consulting company (part-time) working with Access/Excel/GIS/environmental related litigation. 

**My Issues**

* I've only taken 2 stats courses and Calculus (quite a while ago). I do not consider myself good at math
* I'm not familiar with really any ""formal"" data science concepts (Modeling, Error detection and correction)
* I feel like an idiot. I've landed 2 data science related job interviews (Environmental analyst related roles) and couldn't answer basic questions regarding things like water modeling/air quality modeling


Overall, I feel as if I can ""operate the machine"" (use the tools required to work in this field), but not ""make the machine do anything productive"" (conduct complex analysis that derives anything meaningful to a company). The work I've done with the data I've collected for my thesis has been adequate but it's by no means ground breaking:

* Various time-series analysis for determining sensor correlations/relationships between things like: indoor and outdoor air quality, classroom occupancy, HEPA filter operation
* decay curve analysis, basic summary stats
* interfacing with sensors via python, ""hacking""/interfacing with Bluetooth HEPA filters/IR based Air Conditiong units
* Very basic python gui development (Tk)
* basic database design/data base querying (SQL, Influx)

What can I do within this realm that leverages the basic skills I have? What do I need to flesh out to stand-out/prepare for interviews?",datascience,2299,350

"Hi all,

I am building a data pipeline/scheduling solution that runs a complete pipeline only with SQL files, kinda similar to dbt. It can also run Python models.

- The whole pipeline is built from SQL files, no additional code for scheduling at all.
- It can also run Python, in the same pipeline as the SQL assets.
- Pipelines are stored in Git repositories belonging to you, any provider is fine.
- Based on the concept of assets, and allows focusing on business logic.
- It has automated SQL tests for assets; e.g. the order_id column must be unique and not-null, the status column must contain values ""preparing"", ""shipped"" or ""refunded"".
- It can be triggered automatically based on the existence of various files/tables/partitions/query results
    - e.g. Start the pipeline only when the export in S3 is ready
- Runs on a fully managed infra 
- It has the ability to conditionally run tasks, e.g. ""run this task only on Sundays"". 
- It allows you to mix and match dependencies between any task
- It has a UI to manage tasks, logs and pipelines
- No setup/installation is needed to get started, just a text editor

I am mainly interested in understanding usecases that make data analysis hard from infra perspective, and I am trying to eliminate the pain points to empower data analysts and data scientists.

"This query was first put forth on r/econometrics. Posting here to get a more generalized POV on the problem at hand.

Novice forecaster here. I have a time series with daily agri commodity prices. I need to predict prices for at least a month forward. As is with agri commodities, it exhibits seasonality (annual). Based on my research so far, I've heard that SARIMA should do the trick. However, I've heard and seen conflicting information on the forecasting horizon, i.e. the number of time steps in the future you can predict for using the model. One school of though suggests that there is no such limit to the forecast horizon. This mostly comes from textbooks and YouTube tutorials trying to teach SARIMA and/or the ARIMA class of models. The other one suggests that for long forecast horizons, it is best if you take to a recursive approach to predict future values. For example, say the model spec you have picked is SARIMA(2,1,2)(2,1,2)365, then you first forecast the next 2 time steps, then consider the entire series, including the two forecast points in the model and predict again. You do this till you've covered your expected forecast horizon.

I was leaning more to the second method, as it provides a good reason as to why such an approach is necessary: larger the forecast horizon, more likely the predictions would settle at the mean. This is something I did see while using exponential smoothing methods, so it just made sense. That said, I'm also seeing it in my implementation of a recursive SARIMA, which was said to account for this exact same thing! I'd like to believe it's due to some error in my code, but I'd like to cover all my bases. 

Could someone please clarify this for me? Is there any theoretical basis for using the recursive approach, over the other? Also, I'm open to recommendations for other methods that might give me better forecasts, in your opinion. Thanks in advance.

Hello everyone, I'm sorry if this is not the right place for this question. I have been looking for the best subreddit to post this under in hopes of some help, so please point me in the right direction if this isn't the appropriate place.

I'm a PhD candidate working on my dissertation. I've been stuck for about a month on a particular data problem, and I cannot figure it out on my own. I've been trying to contact the statistical support team available to graduate students at my university, and I keep getting ignored (currently CCing everyone in the department to see if it helps). I've found some answers through academic articles and some youtube videos, but it leads me to a second problem.

Part 1. I work with SPSS. I'm working with count data that is under-dispersed. The mean is larger than the variance (M 1.64 &amp; V 1.46). Data do not follow a Poisson distribution (underdispersion). Poisson regression cannot be used as it requires equidispersion (mean and variance are equal), and negative binomial regression is only appropriate for overdispersion.

Part 2. Academic articles tell me that the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution and Generalized Poisson regression can be used with under-dispersed count data, but I cannot find information anywhere about how to do this using SPSS.

Does anyone know (or can point me to any sources) how to address underdispersion using SPSS?

Is there a cutoff point for underdispersion? The difference between my mean and variance is very small (M 1.64 &amp; V 1.46). Would it be appropriate to use Poisson regression with these data?

"Reposting cause other one was taken down for low karma

Hi everyone! After reading the rules I saw that this sub isn’t a “homework helper”; however I’m not asking that anybody does the project itself for me (as I’m genuinely interested in learning and doing it myself), so here’s to hoping it stays up!

So I have this term project coming up for an econometrics class, and as we've just started to learn R, we must set up some multi-regression analysis on a topic of our choosing. As a basketball fan, I chose to focus on the Lakers' notoriously terrible season this year. For context to those who may not follow the NBA, the Lakers were essentially expected to be one of the top contenders for the championship this year; however, they didn't even make the playoffs. As with anything else, people were quick to point fingers, and a great load of them aimed at Russell Westbrook. In short, I want to find a way to prove, or at least suggest otherwise, that Russ isn't the problem (or the only problem). 

My original idea consisted of taking the roster's 6-7 most active players' performances (pts, reb, ast, minutes, etc.) along with other factors such as whether it was a home or away game as my IV's; and setting my DV as whether they won or not. I changed it slightly though as I don't know whether or not using a dummy variable as my DV would be a good idea or not, so instead I was thinking of maybe taking the win/loss margin of games to numerically categorize wins and losses?

So my issue here now is coming up with a way to model this so that I may start collecting the relevant data. Any and all help is greatly appreciated! And I'm still relatively new to R and programming in general so please bear with me in case I get lost in some of the lingo lol

And if anybody has suggestions on particular data to download or anything please let me know!

Also I apologize if this wasn’t the proper sub to post this under, if you know of a better place I can ask please let me know as I’m not trying to disrupt the rules here.

Again, thank you so much!",datascience,2057,385
"This topic has been on my mind lately as I weigh the pros/cons of leaving my current team (nice people, good learning opportunities along with other less interesting responsibilities) vs joining a new but completely unknown team. Team culture is just as important as the role &amp; responsibilities for me, and the former is almost an after thought in most hiring pipelines. 

Speaking to the hiring manager sure helps, but insufficient to understand the team environment, teammates, working styles, collaboration level, work-life balance etc..

I feel culture fit is usually 1-way assessment with the company judging the candidate, but the candidate has no idea until he/she joins the team (in most cases). 

Do you all agree? This issue is relevant industry-wide but DS roles especially as unlike SWE, DS roles can run the gamut from product analytics to nlp to forecasting to experimentation.. So its even more crucial to fully understand the environment beyond what is typically shared in a job posting. 

So I created this post to discuss this. What information about a prospective team would you all like to have before joining a team?",datascience,1141,186
"I see a lot of complaining here about data scientists that don't have enough knowledge or experience in statistics, and I'm not disagreeing with that.

But I do feel strongly that Data Scientists and Analysts are infinitely more effective if they have experience in a non math-related field, as well.

I have a background in Marketing and now work in Data Science, and I can see such a huge difference between people who share my background and those who don't. The math guys tend to only care about numbers. They tell you if a number is up or down or high or low and they just stop there -- and if the stakeholder says the model doesn't match their gut, they just roll their eyes and call them ignorant. The people with a varied background make sure their model churns out something an Executive can read, understand, and make decisions off of, and they have an infinitely better understanding of what is and isn't helpful for their stakeholders.

Not saying math and stats aren't important, but there's something to be said for those qualitative backgrounds, too.",datascience,1065,186

My background: 5-7 years of data science experience (mostly at larger companies) with an analytics/data science masters degree. 

Job application process: I probably submitted 40-50 applications (many of which were through linkedin 's easy apply), which resulted in around 10 interview processes that went past the initial screen, of which 6 went into the final round. Three of the six companies required take home assignments that took anywhere from 2-6 hours. For two companies, I was working with a third party recruiter. All but 1 of the positions was 100% remote, so I don't know if location really matters but I do live in the Midwestern part of America (not Chicago).

I ended up receiving offers from all 6 companies! I listed some info about the job offers below, but with multiple offers I probably could have negotiated some of these up if I really wanted those jobs.

"From the last 2 years, I have been learning Data Science. Due to my inclination towards Research &amp; Coding, I decided that I'll pursue the DS as a Hobby for the time being. I have been into Sales and doing pretty well there. However, part of me always wanted me to choose Data Science as a Career as I believe it is a fascinating domain and you have the opportunity to glide across the various backgrounds while working. 

However, whenever I did my best and dedicate myself for the learning, I find it little bit difficult to comprehend the basics of it.  I have been doing Kaggle Courses for a while and Whenever I go for the exercise, I literally had to look back into the chapters to complete my code. Initially, I though that it is normal for a person like me but when I saw the discussion forums, I read comments from multiples, mentioning that course is very easy to pursue and it is like a piece of cake for them.

"So I was just zombie scrolling LinkedIn and a colleague reshared a post by a LinkedIn influencer (yeah yeah I know, why am I bothering...) and it went something like this:

&gt; People use this image &lt;insert mocking meme here&gt; to explain doing machine learning (or data science) without statistics or math.

&gt;Don't get discouraged by it. There's always people wanting to feel superior and the need to advertise it. You don't need to know math or statistics to do #datascience or #machinelearning. Does it help? Yes of course. Just like knowing C can help you understand programming languages but isn't a requirement to build applications with #Python

Now, the bit that concerned me was several hundred people commented along the lines of ""yes, thank you influencer I've been put down by maths/stats people before, you've encouraged me to continue my journey as a data scientist"".  

For the record, we can argue what is meant by a 'data science' job (as 90% of most consist mainly of requirements gathering and data wrangling) or where and how you apply machine learning. But I'm specifically referencing a job where a significant amount of time is spent building a detailed statistical/ML model. 
 
Like, my gut feeling is to shoutout ""this is wrong"" but it's got me wondering, is there any truth to this standpoint? I feel like ultimately it's a loaded question and it depends on the specifics for each of the tonnes of stat/ML modelling roles out there. Put more generally: On one hand, a lot of the actual maths is abstracted away by packages and a decent chunk of the application of inferential stats boils down to heuristic checks of test results. But I mean, on the other hand, how competently can you *analyse* those results if you decide that you're not going to invest in the maths/stats theory as part of your skillset? 

I feel like if I were to interview a candidate that wasn't comfortable with the mats/stats theory I wouldn't be confident in their abilities to build effective models within my team. *You're trying to build a career in mathematical/statistical modelling without having learnt or wanting to learn about the mathematical or statistical models themselves?* is a summary of how I'm feeling about this.

edit to include a response:

  @ [AnnualCalm347](https://www.reddit.com/user/AnnualCalm347) was kind enough to share :)

At the time, engineering/comp sci internships/co-ops were paid between $21-$29/hr, 37.5hrs a week. The majority of students were offered $24, some students with no prior work experience were offered less, a handful of students with more work experience were offered $25 and higher. The $29 rate I had seen was a single student from Toronto so take that with a grain of salt.

From what I understand the hourly rate was determined ahead of time with HR, I had not heard of a co-op succesfully negotiating a higher rate. I think Telus will decide on the number based on your prior co-op experience, but this is just a guess from my conversations with other co-ops.

If anyone reading this is curious about new grad engineering compensation ([https://www.telus.com/en/about/careers/graduate-technology-leadership-program](https://www.telus.com/en/about/careers/graduate-technology-leadership-program)), in 2020 it was $72 000 with benefits. The starting rate may have changed since then and I don't remember the exact band but over the 3 year program you could expect to get raises (performance based) increasing the compensation up to \~$80 000.

The new job wouldn’t require relocation, but they do want people in office 1x per week whereas I am fully remote at my current role. The commute is really short so I wouldn’t be totally opposed.

Same goes for the monthly subscription model, which seems totally sensible once you deployed your application, but in many cases I'm manually calling the API and don't even know if the data offers any value yet..

I was hired as an analyst doing insurance modeling, premium pricing, marketing data analysis. I Do have 2 close friends at that city.

Y is a top global oil company, locating at a Midwest city close to Chicago (40 min ride). Low living expenditure 850-1300 for rent. Team is white male predominant(I’m a minority). I have to stay at the position for at least two years to transfer to another division like ds or finance.  Pay is 15k higher than X.

"Hey all

Does anyone have experience transitioning DS roles to an entirely new field / domain?  How did you cope with the transition?

For context, I did my PhD in BME, w/ a focus on image processing and computer vision in medical brain imaging.  I had a short part-time role (~11 months) at a biotech startup that overlapped w/ the tail end of my degree and for a few months afterwards.  This role dealt with different types of data but still involved analyses of imaging of various kinds (microscopy).  

Recently (2 weeks ago), I started a FTE DS role at a larger mid-size biotech company.  This role is focused on therapeutic protein design.   I took the role because of the societal value of their work (make drugs cheaper/more accessible), and I wanted to learn about DS as it relates to biologics and manufacturing.  However, beyond basic bio/chem classes and general familiarity with the domain by proximal exposure during my PhD, I don't have direct experience in this field.  During the interviews for this role, I had expressed nervousness / concern that lack of domain knowledge might hinder me, but the company was adamant that my prior skills / expertise would be very useful for their work.

I'm 2 weeks in and feeling pretty overwhelmed by the novelty of the domain.  It feels like I'm learning an entirely new science.  I knew it'd be tough, but I'm starting to feel nervous that I bit off more than I could chew.

Has anyone been in a similar situation, even outside of biotech?  I value the idea of always learning, but I feel like I'm drowning a bit.  One of the more valuable skills I thought I picked up during my PhD was adaptability / resilience in face of new knowledge, but now I'm starting to question the extent of that skill.

I'm usually lurking, but feeling pretty overwhelmed at work currently. For context, I work in a small team (2-4 people), and nobody is specifically trained in data science (my boss does have extensive experience in the data sphere, but not data science).

Has anyone done this and is this a feasible route? I'm digging through research papers but figured it can't hurt to ask here.

"Hello everyone! Thanks in advance for reading and/or replying.

Here's the thing, our pipeline (only structured data) involves:

1) An outlier detection process.

2) Some other stuff.

3) Model training (with hyper-parameters selection).

4) More ""other stuff and optimizations"".

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently introducing new features to the model, so it's time to implement a feature selection step. We decided to go with Boruta algorithm (we use an XGBoost model as feature selector, which is the core of our final model) given that it does not require to train the productive model several times (we train it weekly) and it even performed better than recursive methods. The approaches on the table are:

1) Implement Boruta right before training the model.

Pros: straightforward into the pipeline + infrastructure simplicity.

Cons: we may've removed rows on the outlier processing step due to values on variables that will not be considered into the final model. The data is not abundant. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) Perform Boruta before outlier processing.

Pros: keep all the rows that are not outliers on the important variables (more data to train).

Cons: outliers may alter Boruta's output.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Perform Boruta after step 2 and with those final features re-run from step 1.

Pros: keep all the rows that are not outliers on the important variables (more data to train)

Cons: more time-consuming and not straightforward to implement.

"I'm hoping someone here can tell me what it is like to work as a data scientist at a strategy consulting firm, e.g. McKinsey or BCG.

I'm asking because in the past month, a few recruiters from these firms have reached out to me, but, in my mind, data science/machine learning and strategy consulting are more or less polar opposites. 

Strategy consulting tries to (you guessed it) answer strategic questions. Should we branch out to market X or geographic location Y? Is a merger with company Z beneficial? These problems are wholly unfit for a machine learning approach. Machine learning is good at solving problems that are very operational. Can we predict what products a prospective client is most interested in? Can we match a face on a webcam with an ID so that people don't have to visit a branch to open an account? You take a very small part of a business process and make it better and/or more efficient. Completely different from the 'in what direction should we take the company' kind of questions a strategy consultant deals with. Sure, you can strategically decide to use data science in your company, but that in itself is not a data science question.

Yes, I did pull a little sneaky on ya here by equating data science and machine learning. There's 1000 different definitions of what 'data science' is, but in my mind ML is an essential part of it. Otherwise you're doing data analysis or something else entirely.

I could understand a data analysis and/or process mining role in such an environment, marketed as data science to attract a certain kind of talent. I suspect that's probably what's going on here. But actual data science? I don't really see how that would work

"Hi everyone,

I am about to take an important decision, and I would love to learn from your experiences.

I am an M.Res. in Economics graduate with less than two years of experience. Currently, I am working for a technology start-up that deals with geospatial data. I am the data science manager/lead (it happens pretty quickly, I know :) ). The team consists of an engineer, a data scientist (who deals with deep learning), me, and several data analysts.

***Pros:***

* The company grows (very) fast. I have a stock option.
* My team is producing one of the core products.
* I am directly working with the co-founders, and we have a great relationship.
* I have time to improve myself.
* Remote and flexible working hours.

***Cons:***

* I do not have supervision.
* Although we are responsible for one of the essential products, the way we do it is (very) immature. The batch processes are done manually, and we cannot utilize data science fully because of technical limitations.
* I am the only one with a strong data science background including econometrics and statistics. The deep learning guy is great in his field but only focuses on neural networks.
* There is confusion about data science and geospatial data operations.

For the last couple of months, I have spent my time on two things. The first is an architecture design that allows us to utilize data science much better (including where to get data, how to store, it etc.). Second, showing how utilizing data science better improves our predictions. Also, I am planning to expand the science team, and separate it from the operations team. However, I cannot create the whole architecture just by myself, and our data engineer is leaving.

As a result, I am in two minds: feeling great vs. losing my time. Feeling great because not in many companies, you can increase prediction accuracy from 80% to 90% by researching NASA presentations. Losing my time because according to the Google MLOps paper, we almost fail every checkpoint, at the initial stage of my career I should learn the best practices and the state of art.

Recently, I wanted to test myself in the market. I can move to the HFT industry, thanks to my quantitative background. The wage and bonuses will be higher, but there will be no stock option. The team is more mature, and there will be supervision. However, the environment will be more stressful, and the working hours will be longer. Finally, the data science in the HFT industry is unique/weird. It is much more focused on finding (weak) signals which fail most of the trials.

If you read until this point, thank you very much for your time. Under these conditions, what should I do? What would be your advice?

"# Background:

In August 2021, I walked away from a systems administrator job to start a data science transition/journey.  At the time, I gave myself 18 months to make the transition-- starting with a three month DS boot camp (Sept 2021 - Dec 2021), followed by a six month algorithmic trading course (Jan 2022 - Jun 2022), and ending with a 10 month master’s program (May 2022 - Mar 2023).   The algo trading course is a personal hobby.

# Pre-work:

General Assembly requires all student to complete the pre-work one week before the start date.  This is to ensure that students can ""*hit the ground running.*""  In my opinion, the pre-work doesn’t enable students to hit the ground running.  Several dropped out despite completing the pre-work. I encountered strong headwinds in the course.  I found the pre-work to be superficial, at best.

The Pre-work consists of the following:

&amp;#x200B;

The assessment was accurate in predicting my performance (especially the applied math section).  I didn’t have any problems with the programming and tools parts of the boot camp.

My pain points were grasping the linear algebra and statistics concepts.  Although I had both classes during my undergraduate studies, it’s as if I didn’t take them at all, because I took those classes over 20 years ago, and hadn’t done any professional work requiring knowledge of either.

I had to spend extra time to regain the sheer basics, amid a time-compressed environment where assignments, labs, and projects seem to be relentless.

# Cohort:

The cohort started with 14 students and ended with nine.  One of the dropouts ***wasn’t a true dropout***.  He’s a university math professor, who found a data science job, one week into the boot camp.  I always wondered why he enrolled, given his background.  He said he just wanted the hands-on experience.  At $15,000, that's a pricey endeavor just to get some hands-on experience.

The students had the following background:

&amp;#x200B;

* An IT systems administrator (me)
* A PhD graduate in nuclear physics
* Two economists (BA in Economics)
* A linguist (BA in Linguistics, MA in Education)
* A recent mechanical engineering graduate (BSME)
* A recent computer science graduate (BSCS)
* An accounting clerk (BA in Economics)

# Instructors:

The lead instructor of my cohort is very smart and could teach complex concepts to new students.  Unfortunately, she left after four weeks into the program, to take a job with a startup.  The other instructors were competent, and covered down well, after her departure.  However, I noticed a slight drop off in pedagogy.

# Format:

The course length was 13 weeks, five days a week, and eight hours a day, with an extra 4 - 8 hours a day outside of class.

Two labs were due every week.

We had a project due every other week, culminating with a capstone project, totaling seven projects.

Blog posts are required.

Tuesdays were half-days-- mornings were for lectures, and afternoons were dedicated to Outcomes.  The Outcomes section was comprised of lectures that were employment-centric.  Lectures included how to write a resume, how to tweak your Linked-In profile, salary negotiations, and other topics that you would expect a career counselor to present.

# Curriculum:

**Week 1 - Getting Started: Python for Data Science:** Lots of practice writing Python functions.  The week was pretty straight-forward.

**Week 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis:** Descriptive and inferential stats, Excel, continuous distributions, etc. The week was straight-forward, but I needed to devote extra time to understanding statistical terms.

**Week 3 - Regression and Modeling:** Linear regression, regression metrics, feature engineering, and model workflow.  The week was a little strenuous.

**Week 4 - Classification Models:** KNN, regularization, pipelines, gridsearch, OOP programming and metrics. The week was very strenuous week for me.

**Week 5 - Webscraping and NLP:** HTML, BeautifulSoup, NLP, Vader/sentiment analysis. This week was a breather for me.

**Week 6 - Advanced Supervised Learning:** Decision trees, random forest, boosting, SVM, bootstrapping.  This was another strenuous week.

**Week 7 - Neural Networks:** Deep learning, CNNs, Keras. This was, yet, another strenuous week.

**Week 8 - Unsupervised Learning:** KMeans, recommender systems, word vectors, RNN, DBSCAN, Transfer Learning, PCA.  **For me, this was the most difficult week of the entire course**.  PCA threw me for a loop, because I forgot the linear algebra concepts of eigenvectors and eigenvalues.  I’m sucking wind at this point.  I’m retaining very little.

**Week 9 - DS Topics:** OOP, Benford’s Law, imbalanced data.  This week was less strenuous than the previous week.  Nevertheless, I’m burned out.

**Week 10 - Time Series:** Arima, Sarimax, AWS, and Prophet.  I’m burned out. Augmented Dickey, what?  p-value, what?  Reject what?  What’s the null hypothesis, again?

**Week 11 - SQL &amp; Spark:** SQL cram session, and PySpark.  Okay, I remember SQL.  However, formulating complex queries is a challenge.  I can’t wait for this to end.  The end is nigh!

**Week 12 - Bayesian Statistics:** Intro to Bayes, Bayes Inference, PySpark, and work on capstone project.

**Week 13 - Capstone:** This was **the easiest week** of the entire course, because, from Day 1, I knew what topic I wanted to explore, and had been researching it during the entire course.

# My Thoughts:

The pace is way too fast for persons who lack an academically rigorous background and are new to data science.  If you are considering a three-month boot camp, keep that in mind.   Further, you may want to consider GA’s six month flex option.

Despite the pace, I retained some concepts.  Presently, I am going through an algo trading course where data science tools and techniques are heavily emphasized.  The concepts are clearer now.  Had I not attended General Assembly, I would be struggling.

Further, I anticipate that when I begin my master’s in data science , it will be less strenuous as a result of attending GA’s boot camp.

**At $15,000**, if I had to pay this out of my own pocket, I doubt I would have attended.   With that price tag, one should consider getting a master’s in data science, instead of going the boot camp route.  In some cases, it’s cheaper and you’ll get more mileage.  That's just my opinion.  I could be wrong.

The program should place more emphasis on **storytelling** by offering a week on **Tableau**.  Also, more time should have been spent on SQL.  Tableau and more SQL will better prepare more students for more realistic roles such as Data Analyst or Business Analyst.  In my opinion, those blocks of instruction can replace Spark and AWS blocks.

**Have a plan.**  You should know why you want to attend a DS boot camp and what you hope to get out of it.  When I enrolled, I knew attending GA was a small, albeit intensive, stepping stone.  I had no plan to conduct a job search upon completion, because I knew I had gaps in my background that a three-month boot camp could not resolve.  More time is needed.

Prepare to be unemployed for a long time (six to 12 months), because a boot camp is just an intensive overview.   Many people don’t have the academic rigor in their background to be “data science ready” *(i.e., step into a DS role)* after a 12 week boot camp.",datascience,8203,1288
"Hypothetical scenario: there is an imaginary medium/big mature company that sells a certain product or service. This company have all it's invoices, other basic data (such as customer profiles) gathered and some other important KPIs measured, but does not use this data to become a data driven company or to take any kind of decision based on data whatsoever.

"Hi all,

I am quite new to data science and have started to create my own projects to better get to grips with data science on a practical level, however have come across a hurdle. My current project looks at Tweets regarding a company compared to the current stock market price of the same company, my data frame consists of a list of dates, a check column which is Boolean type with either True or False (True meaning there was a tweet regarding the company that day) and the stock market price for the day. Initially I ran a pointbiserialr test in Python from the Scipy package and this has returned significant p value, however I am not familiar with this test and I am somewhat unsure if this actually measures what I am looking for. My understanding is that this suggests that on the day a tweet occurs the stock price is statistically different on average than when there is no tweet, however I may be wrong in this understanding. Upon reconsideration I think an ANOVA test may be better suited where I group the stock price into 4 categories - one for where tweets are made back to back days, one where there are no tweets for back to back days, one for when there was a tweet the day prior and not one the day of, and one where there wasn't a tweet the day prior but one on the day off, group those as such and treat them as independent groups and add the percentage change in stock price from the day prior to the day of next to each day in each group and run an ANOVA test. However I am also uncertain if this would be correct. Any advice on what my current test has measured and if an ANOVA test is an appropriate follow up test would be much appreciated, sorry in advance for my lack of statistical test knowledge.

"Hi fellows data scientists and data engineers, I'm in the field for 6 months now and I find it difficult to find hobbies matching my job. 

I feel that I lose my focus on my main activity when I'm watching a movie or when I'm listening to music. That led to certain anxiety about losing performance and I'm even finding it difficult to go out to a bar to drink with friends or meet new people because I feel I'll lose my grasp on what's important to me: finding a job in the field after my 6 months bootcamp. 

For the sake of my mental health and my well-being though, I can't put aside every source of pleasure for data science and statistics.

"I work in biotech, and have always used GitHub in the following way: we have a production branch and a development branch. I make feature branches off the development branch to test one feature at a time, then when I feel it’s ready I have a colleague or my boss test it, and then it gets merged to the dev branch. Rinse and repeat. While working, I commit liberally to my feature branch and I generally do a git push at the end of my work day. This is mainly so that a) my boss can see what I’ve done and we can discuss it, and b) it’s safeguarded in case a colleague terminates my AWS instance (did happen once, and this practice saved my ass).

My boss recently told me he only wants me to push fully-finished code to GitHub. So, I should checkout my feature branch, work and commit as needed, but never push it to GitHub until it’s completely finished code.  

All this aside, I actually want to know how is GitHub SUPPOSED to be used? Is either of us right, are both of us wrong, or is this a stylistic choice?

"A lot of people here are early in their careers and may not understand who all fits into the hiring process - and how.

So here's a quick primer.

The hiring manager is the person in charge of deciding who ultimately gets hired. 98% of the time, this will be the person who manages the candidate being hired. The hiring manager is responsible for defining what they want in a candidate, what they will be doing, etc. The way they do this is by writing a *job description*, which outlines the skills and experience a person should have as well as what they will be doing.

The HR comp department will then take a job description and grade it, i.e., decide how much someone in that role should be paid. This is the team that says ""if you want someone with 3 years of experience and a grad degree, they should get $Xk a year"".

Then comes your HR business partner. As a hiring manager, you don't normally talk to the comp team directly. Your HR BP is the one who coordinates everything, and they can also be the one to give you insights into how a JD may influence comp. Example, they may tell you ""if you make a grad degree optional, the max they will approve is $100K-$140K, if you want to go higher than that, you'll need to require a grad degree"".

Then there's the recruiter aka talent acquisition. These are the people that find candidates and do the initial screening on them - reading resumes and conducting an initial interview.

Important callout: a data science recruiter likely has no experience with data science. However, if they are good recruiters, they understand what data scientists do *and how they talk about it*. Having said that, they're only screening - they are mostly making sure that what you said you did is legit, and that it generally matches what the hiring manager wants.

Most of the rest of the process is handled by the hiring manager, with HR primarily helping administratively - setting up meetings, sending emails, etc.

HR doesn't make decisions (other than screening and grading). HR is there purely to carry out their process.

Points of conflict between hiring managers and HR:

1. Bad grading: you put together a reasonable job description, and the grading comes $50K under what you expected. Normally this happens when companies use bad comparison points (e.g., to find comparable salaries to DS they use ""IT professionals"", or instead of using data in your high COL city using state-wide data). That can lead to ""job description padding"", when you make the job description much demanding than what you're willing to hire so you can pay what you want. 

2. Bad screenings: your recruiter filters out people because they have a MS in biostats instead of stats, or they just don't know that operations research is a relevant discipline. Or they will let people through that don't have the right experience. 

3. Lazy recruiters: recruiters do two things to find candidates - look at who applied, and actively look for candidates who may be passive. Lazy ones don't do the second part.",datascience,3023,529
"Compensation-wise: about 30% more than I was being paid before I started. I actually have what most high achieving people would consider, a good job. I was already at a fairly good job before if you’re wondering why only 30% increase.

Future-outlook: A lot better. I certainly feel more respected at work, and more confident in my career. The industry is still at it’s birth, so if you study the right things, there are a lot of opportunities to accomplish what you want compared to most fields/industries.

Advice for beginners: the first 3-6 months are the hardest. You’re really new in the space, opportunities will not come easily then. Just keep LEARNING. Consider applying to other jobs that are easier to get but have the opportunities to interact with data people. Like internships, data entry jobs, volunteer work, etc. Heck, I’ve interacted frequently at work with people from customer support, sales, product management, etc. whom we were able to get setup with their own data environment because they were interested in learning and pulling the data they need. If you’re not sure where to start, there are great blogs, quora posts, cheap online platforms, etc. It may seem like an endless amount of information, but I’ve found that most information is useful and can lead you to other information.",datascience,1310,219

Can you take the standard deviation of the difference

Say you predict the material property of a new compound based on your trained algorithm. You get a predicted value and you get the standard deviation from your testing data:

    value = 500
    sigma = 8

Could you give your result as:

    value +- 3 sigma 
    [476 .. 524]

and claim that based on the available data you have a 99.7% probability of the compound property being in this range?

I'm not a data scientist, I develop a time management / productivity software that aims to reduce meeting load.

Does that observation ring true to you? Why or why not?

"First time working with non technical manager whose domain is industry knowledge and not data/statistics. Most days they know what they don’t know, but sometimes they want to drive some analysis in questionable ways to me.

For example, they asked that I remove 20%+ of the random sampled data so that we could build a perfectly smooth curve fit for only &lt;80% of the data. By eyeballing the visuals. I explained to them that these data points, though not fitting well visually on their “ideal” curve where the majority of the dats is, are not definitionally outliers. They were randomly sampled by our chief DS, there was no data entry errors and they belong to our target population. By removing them we make the data seem more predictable than it actually is, and invalidates conclusions. To no avail.

In similar veins, another time they asked for another “perfect” curve based only on averaged data, which removes all variability in our raw data. I found a post describing exactly what they wanted to do [here -  they want to do chart #2 instead of #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/d5w6ht/linear_regression_all_data_vs_averaged_data/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) - which explains consequences of doing so (“Ecological fallacy”). I ran both analyses, showed them that the first approach generates a curve that is closer to what chief DS expects. But they say the curve through all individual data points must surely be skewed by the 20% of data points that don’t fit the curve as perfectly/closely. 

I have &lt;5 years of experience, top undergrad in Econometrics and am completing my Master’s in DS. They have 30+ in industry. I’m within my first year working with them so I’m at a loss of what to do.

For more context: I’m junior, so my model isn’t the primary moneymaker here. We produce one out of many inputs that go into business decisions. I guess in that sense, their approaches don’t automatically endanger the business, their or my job. But they will present this to upper people at some point. Their priority is to show a clean and easy to understand “model” as the audience is also non technical. Even so, if it’s the way it currently is, I feel that I shouldn’t have my name on it.

"I'm beginning to think that the data science job I want doesn't actually exist...

I've had three roles in in the DS industry and I've come to believe that there are three DS archetypes:

(1) the Researcher; these are the guys/gals who invented Fb Prophet, for example. Their work is all about R&amp;D to bring a tool that could support many, hypothetically infinite downstream problems, and performance on benchmark tasks is emphasized. Without a PhD, it's hard to get considered for these sorts of roles.

(2) the Engineer; these are the folks who seldom invent truly novel models but more often train and deploy established models as a service. They're not inventing the next world-class language model, they're using transfer learning on BERT to build an MLaaS product. I've had these roles before but find them unsatisfying; the answer is almost always 'more data' or 'better hyperparameter tuning' but understanding the inner-mechanics of the model takes a back seat to knowing how to integrate a model into a production environment (CS-heavy, which isn't my background.)

(3) the Statistician; these are the data scientists who are interested in understanding the user-product ecosystem. Their output isn't a deployed model but articulating 'who, what, where, when &amp; why.' Their output is tangible and 'unblocks' executives when a decision needs to be made.

My current role by far is most aligned with the Statistician archetype (DS product analytics at Meta.) My personal interest area is in Bayesian statistics. I find hypothesis testing to be reductionist and view Bayesian methods as holistic models that better answer 'who, what, where, when &amp; why.' Yet, Meta has a very fast-paced, impact-oriented culture.

Sure, I could do regression analysis to infer the interaction of age and gender on product usage. But it's an unspoken rule that I'm discouraged from doing so. It's preferred that I visualize relationships, formulate a hypothesis and generate some confidence intervals, using our experimentation platform. Nobody cares about quantifying the magnitude of the interaction; they're much more binary (significant or not? Decide.) The cadence is so fast that there isn't an appetite for a fully Bayesian approach.

I feel that my dream job might not exist. I'd love to take a real problem, draw up a diagram of relevant variables, define a model in PyMC3 or Stan, use MCMC simulations, and visualize the posterior to better understand 'who, what...'

Any thoughts on this? Do you agree with my archetypes (would you add/remove/modify any?) And any hints on where I might look for the flavor of DS more aligned with my pitch?

I'm very close to saying 'F it. I'm making cash/stocks at a growth company, my dream job isn't worth giving up a good deal.'

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 1: Yes, the data donkey is definitely a relevant archetype. And if I'm honest with myself, my role is some combination of statistician and donkey... currently, pulled more in the donkey direction.

"Hello!

This question will likely end up being moved to StackOverflow but for now, I am looking for assistance finding a good R Package for this. And I did spend a long time trying to google for this and I found many results, too many.

I am trying to create a project in R that will allow me to take in my own transaction history using CSVs from Mint and label the merchants from the description. This seems like a simple if statement but it is actually far more complicated for two reasons. First, Some companies (like Target) use a custom description for every transaction ""Central Checkout \[ID\]"". And second, if I go to a brand new store I would like the model to attempt to determine the store from the description (and I can correct it if needed), so I don't have to update the list of potential merchants every time I go somewhere new.

So my question is, would a masters holder be able to work on in-depth projects, too (especially if they did a masters thesis)?

"TL;DR: this is the most candidate friendly market I've seen for people with literally any level of actual experience - but the most brutal I've seen for people with no experience. If you have to, make it a priority to get *any* experience - even if non-DS related.

I've been a hiring manager for several roles over the last 4 years. In every case, I was looking for people with some experience - small teams, so I wasn't really in a position to take on a candidate to raise myself - I needed someone who could function pretty independently.

It has been hell. Everyone who has even 1 year of experience as a data scientist is going to be inundated with offers, and now that remote work has fully opened up, even in average COL cities you're fighting companies offering East/West coast salaries. 

On the other hand, every job ad I've put out has been inundated with applications from people with 0 experience.

What does that mean?

* When choosing an academic path, focus on something that will make you stand out - not on the path of least resistance. Example: I see a lot of people go routes like ""I got a BS in humanities, so I don't want to try to get into a MS in Stats because I'd need to cover too many prereqs, so I'm gonna do a bootcamp"". That is the wrong mentality. That will land you in the really long list of candidates that look like that. By contrast, someone with a legit humanities background and a legit MS in Stats will look *a lot* more interesting. 

* Evaluate programs based on how well they place students into jobs. This is especially true for MS in DS programs who normally put a lot more effort into it. Go on LinkedIn and see where their grads go work and in what roles. For example: a lot of programs will send their grads to entry level DS roles at companies where DS = Data Analyst. Which isn't bad - but it's a different baseline than starting out as a legit DS. As an example: I tried to recruit Texas A&amp;M's stats department for MS and PhD students and most of them had offers lined up from FAANGs or NYC ad tech/fin Tech jobs. 

* As soon as you hit the 1 year mark at your job, start applying for your next job. I don't know how long this era will last, but right now companies are desperate to hire and they know they need to pay up to do so. Take advantage of that. This is not the era to sit around and hope your company will give you a raise higher than inflation. Go apply for jobs. 

* If you're not getting call backs and you have either a) a strong academic background (e.g., grad school from top 30 school with research publications), or b) any legit DS experience in a full time job, immediately assume that your resume needs work. Seek help, and not from academics, but from people in industry or professional resume writers. This sub can be helpful too.

EDIT: Two caveats here:

1. This doesn't apply to those on F1 visas. Getting a job on an F1 visa is going to be 10 times harder than if you already have a green card or you're a citizen. No way around that. 

2. If you suspect your resume may be an issue, listen to this podcast episode and look at the sample resume attached. If you want me to help you out, do that step first so we can speak the same language. https://www.manager-tools.com/2005/10/your-resume-stinks

* if you're having trouble landing the DS job you want, find a DS adjacent job and then move into DS in a year. Having even 1 year of real world exoerience will make hiring managers a lot more likely to hire you.",datascience,3492,655

"Are there good models to investigate which nodes in a hierarchical network contribute most to a response? If not network, then hundreds of nominal or ordinal features?

I work with materials that have a very large number of batch produced sub-components, which may be used in multiple ""lots"" of end goods (Preclinical Pharma). I have attempted to use random forest weightings, but they weren't very successful in cases with highly unbalanced data, or with materials that have highly correlated sub-components.

I usually hand investigate sub-components via domain expertise, but was hoping there are better solutions to generate investigative leads. 

I don't think I really have the ability to use something like Shapley values, as testing with / without is cost prohibitive. One-hotting doesn't seem to work well either as it turns hundreds of columns into ten thousand.

"Hi,

I have a use case: There is a Kafka topic emitting messages continuously, and I want to keep the last X minutes of messages (based on some field timestamp in the schema) in a Pandas data frame, and of course update it as new messages arrive (i.e. by removing older messages). The goal is later to run queries on the data frame using DuckDB.  


Now of course I can simply append new messages to the data frame and remove the old ones using a Pandas filter. But is that efficient/the most efficient one? Is there some way to ""index"" that timestamp field to make things faster? Or even better, keep the data frame ""sorted"" on that field? What do you do for such a use case?  


Please note that the final ""data structure"" needs to be something supported by DuckDB which I believe leaves us esssentially with Pandas only.    


Many thanks

"I’ll do my best to provide some context here - I work for a very large performance based call center. My title is not officially Data Analyst but just Analyst. However, based off what I’ve read online, a lot of my tasks are very similar. I am required to understand and execute relatively complex SQL queries, work with Power BI, Excel, and I will soon be asked to work with Python. I started at the bottom of the food chain as someone who made the calls and worked my way up. I don’t have any formal education but have only a few classes left for my associates in computer programming. I do have formal education in databases and Python. A lot of my tasks include but are not limited to:

- Create outbound call/email/text lists with various parameters that have included millions of clients
- Compiling both internal &amp; external call stats for various reports, KPI’s, and associate scorecards
- Integrating and managing internal sites that are utilized by lower level employees for stats &amp; rewards

Some of these tasks are somewhat high risk considering the fact that a lot of places have certain laws against receiving calls during different times, reasons, etc. As well as putting together scorecards for people that make the calls since this will ultimately quantify their performance for managers/supervisors to make decisions on raises &amp; bonuses. So there is very little room for mistakes with some of my tasks. 

My annual salary is about $48k in the Midwest region of the US. I have a total of 4 YoE working for the company, but only a few months in this position with no other experience as an analyst. At first I was okay with the compensation (not being much more than what I was making on the phone) because I wanted the experience. But after reading about some peoples jobs &amp; salaries making 6+ figures and working half as much as I do, I’m not so sure. And maybe I’m just being bitter, but I always have and always will strive for something that’s better if I can. 

Does anybody have any advice? Should I stick it out for a while and continue to climb the corporate ladder here or look for somewhere else to go? I definitely wouldn’t mind some new scenery.",datascience,2187,388

"I'm going through a rather large data set and with this many TB to start, I recognize a familiar feeling. There has to be a more efficient, effective and economical beneficial process for this, it kind of hit me one day that while there is a PEMDAS for the Order of Operations in algebra, what is there for algorithm choice when doing data science work?

There is PEMDAS for the algebra stuff = 100% efficient ! Since 1898

There is SCIEM for the stats/data stuff = XXX% efficient ? Since 1983

There is CRISP-DM for the MBA-ish stuff = XXX% efficient ? Since 1996

There is My-Process for a smattering of all three = X31% efficient over 6 years

Is there a unified theory for all of this and my initial findings is that there doesn't seem to be a single obvious, nor one that is unified theory for Data Science... yet?

PEMDAS was drilled into me by the schools and this is computationally 100% totalitarian dictator enforced and there are no dissidents allowed.

I walked across SCIEM, which stands for Split test, Misc Cleaning, Impute Missing Values, Encode/Scale, and Modeling the data; Has a locus of for math or algorithmic model for data processing.

Then you have CRISP-DM which is for Business understanding, Data understanding, Data preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, Deployment; Has a locus of process for MBA-ish data management

While I have 6 years working in finance as an advisor we used heavy amounts of analysis to understand the customers goals, risk tolerance, event horizon analysis, and how much time or effort they wanted to put in. We had a heavily defined process that came from regulation and we have millions of case studies showing that this specific process was heavily weighted in success. I mean it was so ridiculously displayed in the data that it was practically newtonian in the reliability, that it looked familiar but I couldn't quite recall where I saw it first. It was so effective that those of us who just followed this process and logged it independently in excel noted a simple wave pattern emerged and the frequency became quite obvious, it was logarithmic.

So when we met clients we had an incredible amount of confidence in our probability of success, so clients frequently said yes. We gathered data, asked a trainload of questions ended that meeting, scheduled the next and went to input data. Subsequently we used heavily modified Monte Carlo and HMM plus a smattering of other algorithms but always there was a process that BlackRock software had us enter the data in. Then we progressed to the next step, check our assertions vs a backtesting application and then go back into optimization in a sort of hybrid efficient frontier.

The output of all this was incredible and I never had one client come back to say they had gotten a better analysis by Schwab, DA Davidson, LPL, Fidelity, Prudential, Vanguard, JP Morgan, Allianz... but the constant outlier that amazed me was Goldman Sachs. Every freaking time they had an additional edge, tweak or an ensemble of things and we almost always had a less effective model in their &gt;$375,000 assets projections.

So I said all of that to show that in some fields they absolutely have found a process, or THE PROCESS and deviating from it was economic suicide or at least a glutton for punishment.

I'm fairly confident that objective data inputs are generally solvable such as identifying a chair (especially if it's a specific chair) in an image but am far less sure about other scenarios.

The concern is that for CLV you do not have a ton of data on that specific individual and there are a ton of factors that drive purchase volume such as competition, macro economic forces, and ongoing business changes.

This toy dataset shows water consumption values for a single household, with a data-providing water meter attached to the water line. Now, this dataset shows us at different timestamps throughout a day, in chronological order, how much water is being used per each use of water. The ""ID"" column attaches assigns a unique ID to separate each water use event. The ""Value"" column shows a value attributed to the rate of water being used at that timestamp (just made up here). A key assumption this conceptual example relies is that there can only be one water use event at a time.

And so, through python, I group this dataset by ""ID"" and create a separate plot for each ID, as a data subset. And so I have a plot of data showing a curve of water use rate ""Value"" over the course of time duration for each water use event, last anywhere from say 5 minutes to 15 minutes. Now, some of these curves might actually be represent someone washing their hands, or washing produce in the sink, or taking a shower, etc., but we don't actually know! Still, we can hypothesize that each of these types of water use events will be roughly categorized by curves that look similar, when you have a high enough sample size of water use events to analyze. And so first I want to group all like curves/subsets together, such as to say ""hmmm ok these two curves go up a bit, then waaaay up, then flatten out, then go up a bit more, and then shoot down, yeah these two both look like that. And this is waaay different looking than the shape of that other curve, that one must belong to a different group. And so from this I would create this dataframe:

"In this post, I want to share why I got into data science and use it as a platform to solicit others' stories. It's taken me three roles in the industry to really zero in on why I'm here, but I finally stumbled on it: *I like solving puzzles, it's fun to me*. 

Your reason might be you want a dependably high salary for the remainder of your working career, you want the prestige/attention that the role garners in the media, you want to anchor yourself to a growth technology and feel that any combination of stats/ML/AI isn't going anywhere, or maybe you just want a job where you can put your headphones on, code, and be left alone for about 50% of the day. There's really no wrong answer, but I think knowing your motivation for entering and/or staying in the field is vital to avoid burnout. 

For me, every one of my three roles has been vastly different. I've trained and deployed models, who were architected by other folks in the org (J1), used transfer learning to build an NLP-based product feature (J2), and most recently, I use stats and experimentation to optimize product-market fit (J3.) Frankly, I found training, deployment, and transfer learning to be a little unfulfilling. It was the hottest area of the new hot thing, and...I felt pretty empty.

"Hey there,
I am currently working on a Marketing Mix Model.
I am having doubts on my modelling approach. 
I didn't find any sources which fit my idea and I want to know if my approach makes sense to you or what could be the caveats with it.

I have ad spend data for two marketing channels for multiple years.
I have around 30 different entities with the according revenue. 
I know that this is panel data. 

My initial approach is to aggregate the revenue over all entities and model this with the ad spend for the two channels for each entity. This gives me 60 variables measuring the ad spend for each channel in each entity for each point in time. I cannot aggregate the ad spend over the entities as I need to know how each channel in each entity contributes to the total revenue. 
A problem with this approach could be that especially for smaller entities their effect on the total revenue could get lost in the noise due to aggregation. 


Other approaches could be to train a model for each entity on it own but some entities are really small and don't have much variance in their ad spend which could be a problem. Also this is tedious as I have to evaluate many models.

Other than that I should probably look into Panel Regression/ Linear Mixed Models.

What do you guys think? 
How did or would you implement a model with data like this?",datascience,1349,249
"So clutter becomes part of a fast moving industry and when I think about this I get a quote from Demming ""Make quality part of the process"" which basically means clean as you go.

This sounds great but over time there is more and more files, folders of info I need to analyze, and my personal archive of data, files, documents, research is somewhere in the 15Tb region which is connected to 260+ GitHub repos. My research library is 1,000+ eBooks and I don't even want to think about my music/video/photo archive right now. 

Now all client data goes back to them, gets deleted or just stays with them, this is data I found, sourced and used for research to work on models that I delivered and got to keep the code but its a hydra that needs a leash.

How do you organize code that is in multiple stages, yet git is a big help, but what about the data associated to each project. Do you store that in one central SQL server or break it up... and saved where?

How long do you keep training data you were sent by a client, how do you document your process in some kind of [README.md](https://README.md) file or a central index somewhere.

I've asked a few friends and waiting to hear back but I thought lets check with Reddit people.

"A few months ago I had a meeting that I never expected to actually happen, where an employee at a client meeting brought up ""how hard can it be"" to just start running Machine Learning against their databases one at a time and that the ""IT"" department just wasn't wanting to put in the work.

I asked him if he was willing to put in the work for a generalized solution and said ok ""I'll send you a paper, please read up on that and report back what you find"" the following week I sent him this paper. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-019-09914-9#code-and-data-availability](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-019-09914-9#code-and-data-availability) At subsequent meeting he isn't as verbose or hostile against the IT department for being lazy. 

My initial reply was to ask how much data all three of their primary data centers had collected, including the archives, the Oracle Cloud, Google Cloud, both of the failed Azure setups and including their growing AWS presence. How much data in total they had, when was it acquired, how was it cleaned, how often was it used in analysis each month and he looked at me with the ""me not know what you say"" look I see way to often.

So the answer after much back and forth, checking totals, provisioned vs in use and inclusive of non empty folders only is somewhere north of 34.12 Petabytes and somewhere south of 61.3 Petabytes of data. Ok there were little to no data sanitation records, they had about 7% of it had been documented as ever having been analyzed. This data is somewhere between a few hours old and they have information going back to the 1930's in a massive micro-fiche database, then news papers before that and accounting records to the 1700's.

I had this joke in my head about, lets run a regression, of the regression. Then it evolved into turtles all the way down but I kept digging and maybe found something, maybe.

Looking at that much data is just to quote Judith Viorst's book ""the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day"" series of nearly impossible tasks like shoveling sand at the beach to sort it by shape or color etc. There is just too much to run any type of analysis without rethinking the problem which lead me to a few papers I read years ago. This cannot be a new problem, in fact as NTT data has also found its a forever problem. Ok this is starting to sound more fun.

Then I found this paper and somewhere past section 3.1 I can't follow the logic or math to understand what they are saying [http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/112513/7/WRAP-multiple-influential-point-detection-regression-spaces-Leng-2019.pdf](http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/112513/7/WRAP-multiple-influential-point-detection-regression-spaces-Leng-2019.pdf)

Question: On page 386 of the journal article when they say ""leave-one-out"" that refers to a concept like dropout for training ML where you leave holes in your backtesting to see if the model catches itself and doesn't make the error or makes the error and needs fixing?

Has anyone here mucked through this much data before while looking for?

1. Correlation to customer satisfaction that leads to additional purchase
2. Correlation of a customer purchase that leads to said customer referring another
3. Since an aspect of this company is publicly held they are looking for impacts on market price
4. If we go down this road, what can I advise or recommend we do while we are (potentially) looking at this much data. I'm thinking some sort of meta tagging system that would be like time\_series, purchase, market\_segment, net\_promoter\_score, lifetime\_revenue, and so on.

My current plan is to recommend they start by classifying all of the data, one folder or one table of each database at a time programatically with an ensemble of methods. Then expand from there, but there has to be a better method than boiling the ocean.

So this is a medium sized planet of customer time series purchase analysis but while I've done stuff that spans centuries and countries with maybe 30 + variables this is a new species of data analysis.",datascience,4063,664

"Hello,


The Gower distance, or Gower similarity coefficient, is the main recommendation when dealing with mixed data attributes (numerical and categorical).
The following note proposes an alternative that relies on the distance between the probabilities of the attribute values. The idea is relatively simple: has it been tried before? And if yes, what are its main drawbacks?
It seems that such a probabilistic distance should have some advantage over the Gower distance: less outlier distortions and natural extension to ordinal types.

If I can get it, I'll be over the moon. Luckily, because of the holidays, I was given an interview in mid-January and was wondering if there is anything I can do in a month to maximize my chances of getting it.

To provide some context, I am a marketing data analyst (with less than a year of experience in the industry) who just completed a 6-month data science course. I learned a lot from the course, but don't have enough practical experience. This position asks for experience in two ML algorithms  (boosting, clustering). I am willing to grind for the next month if it meant that my chances of getting this position would increase. What can be done?

Edit: For those who think that I ""faked it"", I never wrote anything that isn't accurate on my resume. It's the first interview I've got after many rejections. Just because someone gets an interview for a position that requires more experience, it doesn't mean that they lied in their application.

Some of the more egregious examples from my interview:

- Only knows about using AIC/BIC for model evaluation. When I talked about using a validation set to measure out-of-sample performance, he didn't seem to know what I was talking about.
- I mentioned that logistic regression is regression with a sigmoid activation function. He mentioned that it's been awhile and he doesn't remember theory. I was only talking about the forward pass and not optimization. I feel like knowing the basics of logistic regression should be known if you have been in industry for awhile.
- He gave me a coding question that had a very straightforward O(N) solution. After I gave my response, he said it was worse than using a sorting method. Not only does sorting have worse runtime, his solution didn't account for edge cases.

"#TL;DR - Move to a tech hub for more opportunities, better mentors and peer group, ease of job hopping, and higher pay. There's some data and a whole lotta anecdotes.

**Caveats:**

* Applicable mostly only to the US
* Focuses only on SWE and DS roles (sorry PMs, PgMs, Project Managers, etc.)
* Way too many anecdotes for a post written by a Data Scientist

**Background**

I recently made a decision to move from a HCOL tech hub (SF Bay Area) to MCOL city (Atlanta) because I have the ability to work remotely.

I'm fairly established in my career and I lead DS, DE, and ML for one of the bay area tech companies after having spent over a decade in multiple FAANGs.

I actively mentor a lot of junior engineers and scientists and recently got involved in a non profit to mentor some college students who come from non traditional backgrounds. One question I keep getting is about the value of moving to a _tech hub_. I see the same question often repeated here.

Given my role, and quantitative leanings, I did a quick analysis of job opportunities and thought I'll use this as an opportunity to share my findings and my perspective on the benefits of moving to a tech hub. This is by no means a universal truth or an objective measure of quality of life improvements you gain by moving to a tech hub. I recognize that different people have different needs and different wants, and decisions like where to live are deeply personal. 

So here are my reasons for why you should move to a tech hub given the opportunity and ability.

**Reason 1: Number of Opportunities:**

[Number of Open SWE and DS Roles](https://imgur.com/a/N6Gh9ai)
Full data along with source [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/168DCZ2AIyUPyISkwhE_HwPiOEVA5roDSSpzjKw8Rgc0/edit#gid=0)

As of today, there are ~297,000 open Software Engineering and Data Science roles in the US. Of these, ~94,000 (32%) are remote. Let's exclude remote roles from this analysis for reasons I will lay out in the next section.

If you exclude remote roles, a full 53% of the roles are in the top 4 tech hubs, namely: SF Bay Area, DC Metro Area (I reckon there is an over-representation of government related tech jobs), Greater Seattle Area, and NYC Metro Area, with ~19% coming from SF Bay Area alone. If you look at the concentration of Big N type roles, I reckon the distribution will look even more skewed.

**Reason 2: Mentorship:**

While remote working has been a boon to many, I think a lot of the younger engineers and scientists are suffering. I'm seeing this first hand in the teams that I lead. We're trying various avenues (Zoom mentorship sessions, encouraging regular non work 1x1s between juniors and seniors, even having day long open zoom sessions where folks can drop in and out to discuss technical problems) to help the younger more junior engineers have a good experience, but it's not been a good substitute for learning through absorption.

IMHO, remote roles are more suited for Senior Engineers and Scientists who have a track record of delivering independently.  I know this is just one anecdote from one company, but mentorship really does work a lot better in person. Just by pure numbers you have way more people to learn from when you're in a major tech hub. 

**Reason 3: Networking and peer group:**

I know this isn't kosher (and anecdotal) to say, but the _average quality_ of engineers and scientists in the tech hubs is a lot higher than the quality in the other cities. My company has open roles in cities that aren't tech hubs and the difference in quality (and quantity) of candidates we get is night and day.

There's a reason why every tech company worth their salt eventually opens up at least a small office in the bay area or Seattle or NYC regardless of their origin. So you not only have a better than average mentorship group, you also have a better than average peer group.

Not to mention the countless industry conferences, meetups, and networking events that happen in these cities. There are just a lot more avenues to meet like minded people in tech hubs.

The flipside of this is the toxicity and competitiveness that comes along with this. The tech hubs end up attracting the best and the brightest not just from the US, but from across the world, which results in an extremely competitive rat race, especially at the leadership levels. But when you're young and inexperienced, what you learn here will go a long way.

**Reason 4: Ease of job hopping:**

This is just a function of 1,2, and 3. But being around other jobs and building a network of trusted mentors and peers means that when you're looking for something new, it's a lot easier to land another job when you're in a tech hub. It is still my biggest fear having left the Bay Area. I always keep an eye on the job market and the really interesting director / principal / senior manager level roles with the kind of pay I expect only seem to exist in the tech hubs.

**Reason 5: Pay**

This is all relative because by most comparisons, the COL in the bay area is anywhere between 2x to 3x the average COL in other MCOL cities like Atlanta, Dallas, etc.

But, anecdotally I interviewed for a Head of DS position at a very well funded unicorn based in one of the non hub cities and their offer (in terms of TC) was way less than 50% of what I was currently making for a role that's at least 2 levels above my current role in terms of scope. When I said this to them, they essentially shrugged and said this is the best they can do without upsetting their current order. So at some point, I will have to accept a significant pay cut. The lower COL more than offsets this, but if you're someone driven by growth and compensation - this is something to keep in mind.",datascience,5740,1012
"Hello all,

Is anyone working within the data quality field or know much about data quality? I have been invited to interview for a data quality position within my company but I have never held a position like this before. I come from an IT background with good knowledge of Python / Pandas and this has got my foot in the door. I'm looking for some advice with regards to these sort of positions and what they entail - the kind of work that will be involved and maybe what a day to day situation is like.

Unfortunately I couldn't get too much from the company (like the tools they use etc) but I know they are just starting to create a division and improve their data teams, so I could be starting at the ground floor and could play a part in creating their processes, procedures and have input on what tools they use.",datascience,820,155

Unfortunately, the result of **most analytical work at my large company seems to either disappear with time** **as a person leaves a role** or exist in a stale, undiscoverable, high-level Powerpoint that gets passed around.  

At the moment I have gotten some good formatting/automation mileage out of using the tagging system in JupyterLab along with nbconvert (to HTML/Markdown/PDF), then storing in Github, but **this seems to mostly work only at the individual person/project level.**

The only tool I have seen try to approach this problem is AirBnB's knowledge-repo and some companies selling archaic Knowledge Base services.

"Howdy,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm building out an internal app to store A/B test results. The tests are run using a Bayesian methodology, and we have a full posterior estimate which we sample with n = 1000 per quantity. We are using DynamoDB to store the rest of the data needed for the app, which has a 400KB size limit per record. The sampled posterior as is given is sometimes too large to be stored in DynamoDB as a JSON array. We can store the posterior estimates in S3 as a plan B and store a pointer in DynamoDB instead, but we don't have any need for S3 beyond this so I'm trying to simplify the architecture if possible by storing in DynamoDB as bytes instead.

I'm looking for suggestions on the most efficient way to ""compress"" a float-only vector. I put ""compress"" in quotes as I expect some standard compression algorithms will be suggested, but I'm not limiting ourselves to just that if there are other methods. Some things I've thought about:  


* Casting from \`np.float64\` to \`np.float32\` - this helps a lot with our test cases, but I am not sure about the implications on accuracy and what problems we could be introducing by going this route.
* binning/""histogramming"" the distribution at some given resolution, but not sure how to decide what resolution/bin size is best to preserve the shape of the distribution universally.
* Sampling fewer than n = 1000, again not sure how best to strike the balance between resolution and storage size
* Storing the percentiles (maybe 1 through 100 by steps of .5) of the posterior and backing into the posterior via inverse CDF, but I'm not sure if this is possible without knowing the form of the PDF/CDF in the first place as posteriors are not guaranteed to take any certain shape unless we always use a conjugate prior which isn't practical.
* As a sort of nuclear option, we can reduce the full posterior to just key statistics like mean, median, and HDI, but as you can imagine, we would prefer to store as much information as possible.
* As mentioned, applying standard compression algorithms but not sure if there are any that are ""better"" for float vectors.

1. ""Model Name""

2. 'Prediction""

3. ""Confidence Score""

So a resolution time of 3.00 days would be at goal.   I’ve currently been using Excel’s NetWorkday formula to calculate the difference since it pulls out weekends and holidays so easy.

The use case is pretty simple. You have 2 million rules for eg: 

|ColA|ColB|ColC|ColD|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|GH192|GHMH|\*|349|
|IHK|HK3999|52|\*|

Each row is a different rule in the above table. Rule #1 is stating that the property/column that has name ""ColA"" must have GH192 as it's value. ColB of line item should be ""GHMH"", ColC could be anything at all. ColD should be 349.    


All the columns in the above table would have logical AND relationship among them.   


LineItems:

|ColA|ColB|ColC|ColD|ColE|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|GH192|GHMH|XYZ|349|T1000|
|IHK|HK4000|52|BAC|TAC|

&amp;#x200B;

In the above table we have two lineitems. The first one is a valid one because it satisfies at least ONE of the rules in the first table.   


The second lineitem is invalid as there is not a single rule in the first table that satisfies it. 

There are no range checks. Just exact matches. LineItem could contain extra properties/columns that may not be present in rules. We do not care about these extra columns. For Eg ColE.

  
Obviously, this is a very expensive operation to perform when you are dealing with 5000 lineitems an 2 million rules against which each line item must be validated. A line item must satisfy at least one of the 2 million rules.   


How would you approach this problem? I could perhaps have multiple instances of validator microservice apis whose job would be to take a chunk of lineitems and validate against 2 million rules. OR vice versa. But obviously that is not going to be a very straight forward task.   

Its web application. User is going to save 5000 lineitems (probably via uploading excelsheet which then gets stored in db). This needs to be validated against the already saved rules in the database. 
It has to be less than 10 seconds because pushing it to a queue and sending notification later is not appealing to the customers. Assume everything is string.
We mostly use .NET core and C# with SQL server or MongoDb. Azure as cloud provider.

What are your suggestions? If you have any? Could Hadoop be a solution?

UPDATE1: First of all, thank you for such a great response. I got only 3 comments on StackOverflow for this question. I love reddit! 

A lot of great suggestions really. I tried SQL with all the optimizations that I could do but it took minutes instead of seconds. 

So I tried creating a Trie. And the result was astounding! I was feeling ambitious so I validated 30k lineitems (10x more than original no. of lineitems) against 1Million rules. And guess what? I was able to do so in just 250ms on my laptop. Insane! 

Though there is a major tradeoff. It consumes about 5-6 GB of memory. Which would have been okay but I have found out that we have over 200 clients so if we do store it in memory then we will have to scale different for different client. It is not ideal. Each client will have its own set of 6Gb worth of rules so we can't club them together. 

Building the trie takes 3-5 minutes so its not like we can build the trie and dispose of it with every request. But I have some ideas to optimize it. 

I wonder if there are any databases that let you store data in a form of trie and query on disk? Ofcourse I could do it with a graphdatabse like neo4j but then I will have to hit it for each lineitem.",datascience,3488,615

"I noticed that a lot of companies fall into the ""no clue what to do with data"" category. I was thinking about starting a company, to service a ""niche"" area within data science. This could be a one-stop-shop type of place where ideally I would be the only employee.

So imagine a small to mid-size company that doesn't have the funds to have a full data scientist or team. This company's core business might be related to tech, it, online shopping or some other industry where they could be losing a lot of money by not making proper use of their data. So instead of hiring a full time data scientist or team, you just bring in someone 'me', who has data science skills, data engineering skills, and analysis skills to do a couple key things:

fix data problems with database, setting up pipelines, getting the right data, etc.

Understanding how data relates to core business, creating actionable insights, building forecasting/prediction algorithms etc.

Maintaining product over period of time, creating something analysts can use, modifying it for future use

So I'd ideally charge some sort of upfront fee such as 10k-50k for the first month, or something like fee based on performance (revenue improvement), and then some sort of monthly fee arrangement for support and maintenance of products.

Example: Right now working on forecasting model with large government organization that could save them a few million dollars per year and lots of hours of headache due to poor past predictions. I could build what I have done in about a month, charge $50k, and then maintain it for 2-3k per month.",datascience,1598,271

"Hello everyone,

First off all, I'm not a native English speaker, so please excuse my mistakes. 

This question might sound silly to most of you, but I'm really struggling to decide whether to use the 'Data Scientist' title or the 'Quantitative analyst' title for the new job that I am being offered with.

To provide a bit of context, I've more than 4 years experience working as an analyst as well as a data scientist at different organizations. Recently I received an offer from a company that provide SaaS solutions for energy markets and the tasks and responsibilities of the new role are primarily focused on developing price models for power markets. 

I feel the Quant tittle is more relevant for the position according to what I am expected to do. Secretly, I have always wanted to be a Quant since I am really passionate about forecasting topics as well as in trading, and I believe this is the ideal opportunity to learn more from very smart people and expand my knowledge in this domain. 

However, I'm a little concerned how the title will affect my future career in the long run. For example, I'm worried that choosing the Quant title will hinder my chances of transitioning into a Data Scientist position sometime in the future, and that I would be treated to be over specialized as a Quant and affect my chances to move into a different domain if I ever want to do it in the future.

I know there's a lot of overlap between quant and data scientist roles, and I know I might be over thinking this. But if someone has any input or experience in being in a similar position before, I would really like to hear about it.",datascience,1633,294

"TLDR: From entry level GIS specialist making $45k at govt contractor to ML developer at same company. How much of a raise should I ask for?

Hi everyone, would appreciate some salary advice as I am moving to a new work role and have no idea what I should be making, (glassdoor etc are all over).

So basically I'm a full time GIS analyst II for a government contractor in a mid-high COL city. I graduated college in 2019 with a B.S. in Geology, now halfway done with my M.S. in GIST. I started my current position right after graduating college.

My boss is leaving and I am taking over all of the machine learning development for our program. (He chose me since I have been a quick learner, have a data science background (college minor) and know Python. I am familiar with all of the Machine Learning/AI workflows (via PyTorch/Azure) and feel pretty comfortable taking over future development although my experience is relatively new. I will also be continuing my old work as a GIS/Remote sensing analyst primary image/lidar processing, managing our statistical outputs and doing QA.

Basically I was hired as an entry level GIS analyst right out of college. Pay started $45,000 and have gotten small COL raises the past 2 years and am now at $46,300ish.

I'm wondering since I am taking over the ML dev should I ask for a raise from my supervisor and if so how much would a fair ask be? I'm in government and still relatively entry level so I certainly wouldn't expect the 6 figures or that some data scientists/ML engineers make or even close to that really, but I do believe I will be undervalued at $46000 especially going from a support role to more of a leadership role in the program. 

I would also like to add that I absolutely love my job and my work culture so don’t plan on jumping ship until I have a bit more experience.

"Machine learning has been possible partly due to the accumulation of data, and within that data, an important step is that of data validation. May it be a data warehouse, database, or data lake migration, all require data validations. It mainly encompasses comparing the structured and the semi-structured data right from the source to the target and subsequently verifying that they match correctly after every step in the process.

**The Data Validation Tool by Google**

Looking at the importance of data validation, Google recently released the [Data Validation Tool](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/professional-services-data-validator) (DVT). This tool will primarily function as an open-sourced Python CLI tool that would provide an automated and repeatable solution for the process of data validation. The researchers have claimed that this tool would work in different environments with brilliant accuracy. The framework that was equipped for this tool is the [Ibis](https://ibis-project.org/docs/tutorial/01-Introduction-to-Ibis.html). This would act as an intermediary link between the numerous data sources like BigQuery, Cloud Spanner, and so forth.

"I know reddit doesn't represent real life, but just look at the titles of this sub. They're all about tools, code languages/packages, and algorithms. I think to most aspiring data scientists, that's how they see the profession. You're given a tech stack, some data, and your goal is to apply x tool/algorithm to y data. My argument is this is only going to work at super junior levels, and I believe it's the reason why there's a huge oversupply of junior data scientists but teams still can't find competent seniors.  


As another experiment, just head over to r/dataisbeautiful right now. You'll see a ton of different techs used to generate some decent and some awful visualizations. All of those people were able to access, clean, and plot data. There's no shortage of people who can do that.

Whether it's recognizing Simpson's paradox, knowing when to keep/stop digging into research questions, figuring out when gathering more data is necessary, knowing how to communicate findings in ways that make an impact, the science part of data science is by far the most valuable. Some people call them soft skills, but I'm not a huge fan of the term. It's science. Unfortunately these are the toughest skills to learn and also the toughest skills to interview for, so I don't suspect you'll see companies steering away from technical questions in interviews any time soon.

"Hey there, new to the career, on my first contract and things are challenging!

I need assistance in building a pipeline that can tokenize PowerPoint PDFs as well as scrape webpages without any fine tuning.

I am basically building an application for the client in Python where they can input a pdf or webpage, a set of terms, and then the model outputs visualizations regarding the terms within the submitted pdf/webpage. 

The outputs need to be greedy and output any numerical values associated with the term. 

Example:

Input document/webpage:
Report.pdf

Input terms:
'Word',
'Words',
'Phrase of importance',
'Second phrase'

Output:
'word sales increased 90%'
'phrase of importance was reduced 15%'
'$20 million of words was sold last quarter'

"Hi all,

**TLDR:**

**Is there a recommended minimum sample size for customer text review analysis per SKU?**

**If I am to limit the number of reviews for a SKU (with some SKU's reaching over 30,000) and I were to limit the number to say 100 reviews per SKU, should I get the full spectrum of rating reviews, or should I restrict the search to just 1-star and 5-star?**

**What are the implications with the above restrictions?**

Longer version:

I'm having a disagreement with my boss about text-mining customer reviews where the reviews give an ""average"" score.

He wants me to only mine 1-star and 5-star reviews to get the most contrast without having to spend on collecting a wider data set.

My argument (which is anecdotal and why I come to you today) is that not only could it adversely affect any unforeseen analysis moving forward, but there could be actual insights that come from mid-level reviews.

Such insights could be ""I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for"" compared to 1 star reviews like ""It's shit and it's the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my life. This hose caused my divorce and not my anger issues"".

Is there anything else in terms of collecting a more representative dataset than the above from a mathematical/data science perspective that I should consider? Minimum sample size etc?

"I guess this is more of a rant and some validation seeking than a question.

I'm a new-ish data scientist with an esoteric math background. Spent 8 years in pure math, decided I wanted more control over my life than you get in academia, and fell into the gutter of data sci (this seems not uncommon for STEM academics). Didn't really code when I was in math so I wasn't able to hit the ground running, but after a boot camp and an internship, I've just started at a salaried career in the city I want to live in (my hometown, a moderately sized Canadian city that's not exactly a tech hub) at a stable company with a solid looking future.

My internship was a pretty wild, small, python dev environment for a general consulting firm that did a little bit of everything with in-house deployment software. I got to do....pretty much whatever I wanted relating to their projects, which was good for experiencing new technology, but sometimes felt like an absence of leadership and unprofessional ""making it up as you go"" development. Version control and testing were poor to non-existent, and I thought that they were going to get in trouble for deploying too much broken shit/developing solutions with a poor understanding of the associated industries.

It was a good learning environment, but made me want to go corporate/large organization to see

1. Enterprise scale data
2. Stronger implementations of best practices.
3. Projects more related to specialized issues (I despise 'general' data science consultants that try to be everything for all industries)

So now, I'm at my corporate job. It's not a software company, but it's a company with a lot of data. My title has the word data science in it, but I'm not sure anyone here does any predictive analytics. Python development is nonexistent (my work laptop is locked down and IT would probably look weird at me if I requested a proper dev environment). It's primarily a BI/analyst driven environment on the Microsoft technology stack. I'm not sure anyone here uses github, and our ""developers"" are almost all IT/analyst types who work making dinky business apps in PowerPlatform or do dashboard-ey and analysis type stuff in PowerBI and SAP.  We have some access to the Azure ML suite, but I think most of the current staff views it with a bit of terror and confusion. Much of the data activities involve managing multiple ERP solutions duct taped together.

None of this is a surprise to me -- I did know what I was getting into, and I knew that it would be a more business analyst type environment centered around PowerBI outputs, but I'm also finding the reality of it a little jarring and am somewhat worried about my more hard skills atrophying.

On the plus side, it's exactly what I was looking for in terms of career stability. It's where I want to live, the benefits are hella tight, there's opportunity for growth, and I don't have to worry about the company going out of business in any given year.

Is this.....OK? Has anyone else made a transition like this? I'm having mental weirdness about it because I've got lots of friends involved in wild cutting edge shit in a range of academic, data science, and software development environments. They're moving around the world, doing cool shit, developing new algorithms, and getting involved with FAANG type organizations. Meanwhile I'm moving into a career path that specializes in making charts for the C-suite to ignore and misuse.

I struggle with the question of ""to what extent do you have the right to a career of your choice in a city of your choice?"" I like it here. It's got a million people -- it's not like I'm living in bumfuck nowhere. But it's also probably never gonna have the kind of cool, advanced data science opportunities that you get in areas with a FAANG presence or more developed tech scene. And I feel like in my social circle, I'm surrounded by people who view working with those kinds of organizations as the barometer of success.

I think I'm OK with this. I think life exists outside of Toronto/NY/Bay Area/Boston/Austin. I've accepted and I'm comfortable with being a person who works to live and having an unsexy job description. For where I live, this is a pretty damn good job and place to work. I think I can be pretty fuckin good at this. I get to leave at 5 PM, not worry about anything, and go off and ride my bike/fuck around in the mountains, which is not a bad deal. I guess I could also try to reevaluate in like 5 years if this is working for me or not.

So....has anyone else ended up like this? How'd it go for you? Any regrets? Are you doing it as a lifer? Did you do it for a bit and then transition out? How'd you manage?",datascience,4686,831

"Hello Community,

So…I got charmed by swift as a programming language since quite a while now.

I was hoping it would partially loose its “Apple image” after going open source but it doesn’t seem to have moved a lot since then.

Swift has in my opinion a great potential rivaling Python (while being able to use its packages) and competing with Julia as a language that’s not only powerful (even though not as capable in terms of accuracy etc), but can also deliver products out of exploration fairly quickly (true, mainly OSX and iOS but…I have a hard time finding a language that gets me a beautiful working UI as easily as SwiftUI does).

Also there has been quite some investment; see for example Tensorflow Swift or Googles efforts on bringing Swift to Jupyter notebooks.

However, all of these ambitious projects seem to be archived by now. The hype for Swift as a future language for everything from a few years ago seems to be gone to me.

I might be wrong; but….what happened? Weren’t we just unable to break the “it’s the iOS Programming language” image? Or are people like me who want to see a future in Swift for data science just an irrational exception?

"In my multiple linear regression model, there are a few negative correlations even though Pearson's coefficient were all strictly positive.
 There could be correlations among the independent values but due to the nature of my data, I know that it just implies linearity and that they aren't actually dependent on each other. 

I know that all the coefficients should be positive and I can't remove any of them since I have to find the correlation for each of them. How do I do this?",datascience,482,84
"**Individual neurons of a vanilla feedforward neural network (FFNN) can be interpreted as feature detectors.** More precisely, a single neuron takes the activations from the previous layer as input, then dots them with the neuron's weight vector, and after passing the output of that operation through a nonlinearity, the final result effectively encodes how ""present"" the feature that neuron detects is in that input activations: Larger values mean ""more present"", smaller values mean ""less present"". So on and so forth up through the final layer of a FFNN.

**Significantly, an individual neuron is essentially just a logistic regression unit**, in that the mathematical mechanics underlying how it works are more or less identical to those used in a logistic regression model. **Given that parallelism, it seems like it should be possible to interpret a logistic regression model in an analogous way, i.e., as a feature detector.**

However, given all the neurons operating in parallel as well as all the hidden layers, a FFNN detects many features, whose combined pattern of presences/absences leads to the final classification. By contrast, logistic regression models have only one ""neuron"" (or really, the whole model *is* the ""neuron"") and no hidden layers. This difference begs the question: **If we are to apply the feature detection interpretation from FFNNs to logistic regression, what exactly is a logistic regression model detecting? What is the ""feature""?**

**What I'd propose - but am interested to know the community's thoughts on this - is that what's being detected is simply ""positive class-ness"".** For example, say the logistic regression model is classifying whether a tweet is positive or negative in sentiment. Then what the one and only ""neuron"" is detecting is ""positivity"". Or if the model is classifying whether images contain cats or not, what the ""neuron"" detects is ""cat-ness"". Or if the model is classifying whether radiology scans contain tumors or not, the ""feature"" it detects is ""contains tumor"".

This is perhaps a trivial reinterpretation of what logistic regression does, because obviously a cat detector detects cats. But in my mind at least, **recasting it as feature detection, and accordingly understanding what ""feature"" means in this case, allows me to unify logistic regression and FFNNs in a very natural way that highlights how their components' objectives are really just one in the same.**

**What do you think about this? Do you think this reinterpretation is correct? Do you think it's illuminating/thought-provoking/valuable? Do you think it's at least kind of a cool way to think about logistic regression?** I'd love to hear your thoughts and discuss. Thanks in advance!",datascience,2727,428

"Hi,

I am interested in working in the field of biotech and bioinformatics, especially AI for drug discovery

A traditional way is to do a PhD in it but I have a doubt that does these fields require huge computational power which narrows down very few Universities that can afford such a large budget for computation.

I am a bachelor in Computer Science and currently applying DL techniques in ophthalmology but the issue is medical image data(high resolution) requires huge computational power and also expensive labelling(By the doctors) and currently, it is the bottleneck in my current work.

Also if it requires huge computation power then I'll not go for it, because I don't have the credentials to crack the top CS PhD programs that can afford such computations.

Also how expensive is the labelling of the datasets, does they require domain specialists?",datascience,924,152
"I have a question regarding NLP clusterization.

I am using SBERT with a pre-trained model to extract embeddings, and k-means to clusterize. The sentences I am using can be really short(sometimes it can be a single word, but around 3-4 words on average), and the datasets are fairly small - around 200 sentences to clusterize per task.

Besides clusterizing, I also need to label every cluster based on its contents.

So far, I have been trying to increase the precision of clusterization by using different cluster counts, but it tends to be unstable. I have tried to clusterize into x clusters, then cut off ""worst"" cluster members(based on center distance or cosine similarity) and recluster them separately.

I have been trying to label clusters with ""best fit"" sentences within a cluster(based on cosine similarity or cluster center distance).

The results don't seem to be too impressive. I feel like the k-means with only 200 data points is a weak spot.. But, still.

"In my work, I am currently working on a text classification project where I have to classify some documents. 

The dataset is approximately 4100 rows long and has 4 classes that I want to predict. It is heavily imbalanced, with one class making up around 85% of the dataset. The dataset is imbalanced because most of the data that the model will face in production will belong to that class. I want to increase the size of the dataset, but it is very time-consuming to do so since I have to tag every document beforehand manually. It took me two entire days to even create this small dataset.

I have been thorough with my preprocessing (lowering text, removing numbers and special characters, lemmatization etc.). For the modelling, I am using a Support Vector Machine model on sci-kit-learn (LinearSVC), resulting in a test accuracy of 99% mean (98.8% median) on a Stratified KFold with 50 splits.

"Title. I come from an RStudio background where the user can call the help function as in Python. The documentation is rich (if only a little esoteric sometimes), with links that lead to wrappers or other functions in the same family.

There’s pydoc files that come with the source installation, and there’s at least 3 ways to call documentation from a Jupyter notebook: the help function, the question mark, and the dir function to print object methods. But many calls to the help function leave me scratching my head. For example, help(str.translate) makes a vague reference to a ‘translation table, which must be a mapping of Unicode ordinals’ and there are no examples.

" Hey [r/DataScience](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataScience/)! I would some suggestions about a DS career paths.

I am interested in pursuing a career in DS because I enjoy looking at statistics and I love how applicable it is to many different topics.

However, it seems to me that all jobs fall into one of three categories: advertising companies, banks, or the stock market. So it turns out that my work would only serve to generate clicks on ads, predict whether a person will pay their credit card, or make a millionaire become a billionaire. Of course, I have nothing against anyone who has this type of job (I'm likely to end up in one of them...).

I want to know what other realistic job options exist where Data Science could be applied. I really like geopolitics, and I'd love to work with social statistics. In my home country there is a government agency called IBGE that gathers statistics about society and I love poking around them, but I don't even know if they have any use for data scientists. I don't know if they have use for predictive data models, which is the focus of Data Science, as their focus seems to be more ""traditional statistics"". In fact, I think the competition for these agencies is restricted to geographers and statisticians, but I'm not sure. I intend to migrate to the EU at some point in the future and I'm curious what opportunities would be there or in the developed world in general.

I would really like to use statistics to understand/help society. It turns out that I'm discouraged to follow this path when I imagine that my work would only be useful to make money. It makes me question whether I should really choose this career.

"Are there any industry standards for mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive attributes for a firm/organization's knowledge? By managing knowledge I mean the ability to capture new information, integrate it to relevant discussions/topics/idea development, access it as a basis for developing new content without duplicating ideas, and broadcasting the new content. 

For example: **Source** (internal, external, **Desired access** (private, public), **Maturity** (ideation, refinement, published), **Date** (of ideation start, last edit, publication) 

These strike me as very useful, and easy to manage the dependencies (i.e. mostly it would be internal sources that would have ideation and refinement, while published could be shared between internal and external pieces of knowledge) 

Then I get to topic... and things start to break down. I've thought about using language as a taxonomy, with **subject** \- **verb** \- **object** as topic attributes: some entity, took some action, directed at some other entity.

Time series for me is a field in which I have very little experience and I’d love some high level insights to understand how to approach a problem.

Problem background: predicting the number of job postings (eg LinkedIn or a job board) in the upcoming week/month to help recruiters/board company optimize for (lack of) incoming openings.

The basic setup is a simple time series of say, counts/logs of jobs posted per day over a few years. 
I think there’s more value if:

1. We don’t look at total jobs listed but try to predict per job title (or some broader category if not feasible). For example the number of predicted data scientist jobs, software engineer jobs, IT management jobs, etc. My idea is to train a text classification model to parse raw job descriptions into job categories, and input this into the time series. Train a separate model per job (category).
2. Apart from the basic trends improve the prediction by adding external features such as macroeconomic indicators (e.g via an API or web scraping) or sentiment related to job posts or news (again using an NLP model to provide input to the time series model). I have no idea how/if this is feasible with specific time series models though (opposed to eg regression).
3. Retrain the model(s) periodically to ensure it keeps close track of latest market trends and external events (e.g new macroeconomic indicators that are released periodically). 

Specific questions:
- what are current “state of art” time series algorithms I could look into? 
- how to best include external variables into such a model? 
- how does prediction timeframe make a difference eg predicting the next week vs month or day?
- generally: does this approach make sense/is it feasible or are there better ways to think about this problem?

Would love some discussion since I feel time series is less often discussed compared to typical classification/regression tasks.",datascience,2080,346

Most of my teammates are really good at math and statistics in general, but once I have to dive into one project, I just lose so much time trying to read their code and understand their explanations.

You work in a Retail Bank and as a Data Scientist you're called by the Marketing and Customer Value Management departments to work on a problem with a data-driven approach.

They figured out that many individual retail customers use their current account and debit/credit cards for business purpose (they are SME - Small Medium Enterprises - disguised as retail customers) and they want to find those 'hidden business' customers in order to reach them out with a cross-selling opportunity (e.g. open also a business account and keep your personal and business expenses separated, allowing lower taxation, etc.)

When you do some EDA on debit and credit card spendings you find out examples of retail customers with thousands of dollars per year spent on Facebook Ads, Google Ads, stores for business purchase only, etc. and you plan to use those features to train a model that identifies the 'hidden business' among the retail customer base.

**PROBLEM**

If your plan is to train a binary classifier you will soon figure out that the problem is that you have positive labels (customers with a business account and debit/credit card) but your negative labels are actually unknown: you don't know if they are hidden business or actual retail customers.

The standard metrics you will use to compute error and performance (AUC, precision, etc.) would be also flawed because you want to find out errors (e.g. customers with high scores of being a business but actual retail) not minimize it.

Also, you will end up doing training and scoring on the same dataset of the overall bank customer base.

So a background of what I will be doing is that I will be helping new clients onboard to our company's SAaS products that is suitable on the client's business environment. Ultimately, I will be training them on our products but will implement the software based on their business needs. 

I have a background in project management and sales so even though the role seems to be a bit more technical, it's one skill I love to learn as I go through it. I can leverage my skills in project management and sales to get me up to speed on this new role. 

But on the other hand, I would want to incorporate some data analytics task to my job since I've always wanted to go to a more technically-focused career. I know that data analytics will have tasks such as data analysis and dashboard reporting, data processing, and perhaps a little bit of statistics. 

I really don't have a formal training on it though I know that the tasks I did in my previous jobs on my own initiative entailed having data analytics tasks. 

But what can you suggest what tools I use to be able to perform data analytics? Even basic excel will do as long as I get to understand the principles of data analytics and by then create a dashboard for my projects/accounts.

"I'm a 26 year old Social Sciences grad considering a return to academia and I'm very interested in applying ML methods as part of a PhD research proposal at the intersection of Political Science / Public Policy and Development Studies.

More specifically I'd like to assess the value provided by ML methods as part of a mixed methods approach to research with the aid of one or several case studies, with significant attention paid to methodological and epistemological concerns, engaging with the work of forerunners in the field such as Lakoff, Zadeh, Sartori and David Collier. As such, applying ML methods would be a significant portion of my research, but definitely a minority. Specific algorithms of interest would be determined by the case studies in question and what I'm capable of competently applying, but would likely centre around regression/classification and text analysis.

Once upon a time I had basic but fairly solid statistical skills along with more rudimentary technical skills in SQL, R and to a lesser extent Python, but these have unfortunately atrophied to the point of non existence after 3-4 years in a non-technical Data Science adjacent role. I therefore have a pretty steep hill to climb in terms of foundational skills before I could even submit my research proposal. I'm currently brushing up on algebra, calculus and statistical skills before pushing in to the unknown, most likely via the MITx Micromasters in Data, Development and Economics and/or in Data Science. However the sheer scope and complexity of the content I need to cover combined with working a full time job and the fact that a PhD position is by no means guaranteed at the end of it (I'm provisionally interested in Oxford or LSE) is pretty disheartening. As a result I'm interested in exploring low code / no code options such as KNIME and DataIku (I'd also welcome alternative suggestions) for data prep and model build to reduce the barrier to entry. I'd really value any input on whether these would be fit for purpose, specifically:

1. Will the choice of algorithms available fit my needs?
2. How low code are they exactly? In practice will I need to plug in significant amounts of my own code?
3. Do they provide sufficient guidance or hand holding to build models of sufficient quality for a top tier PhD program (keeping in mind that building the ML models would only be a relatively small portion of my research - I certainly wouldn't expect this to be the case if it was a purely quantitative thesis). To take some basic examples, would they flag if my variables were collinear, heteroskedastic etc

"I once watched a video where someone argued that Michael Jordan had ruined basketball. As a person whose only notions of basketball come from Space Jam, this surprised me. Wasn't the guy the best out there? How could someone who's best in his field ruin it?After hearing the argument out though, I began to understand what the video was really getting at: to them, Michael Jordan had ruined the field BECAUSE he was so good. A sport that was once full of diverse personalities and strategies and then turned into multiple teams trying to produce their own Michael Jordan copycat with copycat moves and copycat strategies.

I'm not well versed enough in basketball to know how right or wrong that guy was. But this concept that something could ruin an entire field simply by being too good stuck with me. And all these years later, I consistently think about it while doing my job as a Data Scientist. And the more GPT-X and ChatGPT advance, the more this concept haunts me.

I've been working in this field for 5 years. During the first 4 years, the job was exciting. Every new problem required extensive research on my part: looking for papers, datasets, implementations, implementing my own stuff, experimenting, comparing the results... That was the biggest part of my job. Yeah I still had to do some software engineering stuff here and there, but I felt like I had a well defined and specialized role at my company. Even in the NLP field, the variety of technologies I had to work with was a lot of fun: sometimes I used RNNs, sometimes embedding based similarity functions, sometimes more classic approaches, and then towards the end it was transformer after transformer, but at least I still had to finetune them myself.

Over the past few months and years, this has started to change, however. GPT-1 and 2 were promising, but were more of a proof of concept than anything realistically usable. But with GPT3's and ChatGPT's latest performance, it feels like NLP is becoming more and more standardized. I wouldn't call it a solved field, far from it. But, sadly, unless you work for a big tech company,  I think the days of exploratory research-type work in the NLP field are over.

Even in academia, the latest NLP papers I've seen come out of prestigious universities went from actual engineering/mathematical advances to ""Look, if you ""engineer"" the prompt like this, it works better sometimes!""

And now, with the exploding popularity of ChatGPT, any random lambda would come to the conclusion that if you need to use AI, ChatGPT is the answer.

Now, some of you may already be thinking ""but hold on, with my finetuned transformer I get a 1% increase in accuracy over out-of-the-box GPT-3!"". The thing is: even if you can, it doesn't really matter. I really doubt the sales team of your company is gonna pay much attention to your pleas to give you 6 months to work on a product rather than 6 minutes. Because yes, that's the increase in productivity we're dealing with: What took me months a few years ago only takes minutes now. The range of problems I can apply NLP too has also increased, as out-of-the-box GPT-3 works well enough not to require a dataset for more ""general"" tasks. And the results are either comparable or even better.

In the span of a year, NLP went from my favorite ML field to one I never see myself working in again if given the choice. And while a lot of non NLP fields are, for now, untouched by the exploding popularity of the GPT family. But I'm afraid that what happened to the NLP field will be replicated in other fields, and that in a few years, only super specialized issues won't have a solution somewhere in the form of a ridiculously big model accessible via an API key provided by a big tech company. And even if GPT3 was open source, the sheer size of it makes it close to impossible to realistically train for anything less that the biggest of tech companies out there. Even finetuning it would be a challenge.

I'm not saying the job of data scientist will disappear, in fact, I'd say it will be asked more than ever since boomers who don't understand what the title actually implies will want some in their company. But we won't be doing nearly as much actual data sciency stuff as we did in the past. Instead we'll have to become even bigger software engineer/data analyst/DevOps/project manager hybrids than we already were.

It's not that much of a problem for people who like the roles I listed above. But for people like me, whose enjoyment came out of the exploratory side of the job, I believe the future to be bleak.",datascience,4578,808

"Hi everyone, 

I'm currently trying to choose a topic for my master thesis in Data Science and would like to write about nlp.

A bit about my background: I didn't have a background in Computer Science, actually I have a master in business administration and am working as a data analyst, but mostly I work with excel and power BI, so I am at the very beginning of the journey. I like working with numbers and data a lot, I'm pretty good at math and am okay with staristics, so I thought I might be suitable for a career in DS. I started my master programme in DS 2 years ago, and hell I did suffer. During my master programme I worked full time (I still do) and it was very challenging for me to learn programming from scratch while at the same time working on projects in Big Data and Machine Learning. But I did like the new things I learnen very much, even though I still feel like I don't know much about DS after 2 years studying (the programme was a bit bad actually, one professor said we will not be qualified to work as a real data scientist after graduation but maybe as project manager in the field). So, for my master thesis I thought to myself I want to learn as much as possible and write a really good thesis, so that I will be able to switch to a job in the field. 

After researching for very long I decided that I will write my thesis using Twitter data, because they are easily scraped and ressourceful. I read some articles on Medium/towardsdatascience about nlp, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, network analysis, all very interesting. I want to learn the topic from scratch, read some good books and academic papers, learn from some good projects, but I don't know where to start. My professor said I have to work on my thesis all on my own he would only tell in the end if it's okay or not, so I have almost no help from him. 

Do you know any good book in this topic? Maybe a good course or a good project? I was thinking about sentiment analysis of tweets about a specific topic, and then perform topic modeling with LDA... what more could I do? 

Thank you all so much in advance for you advice!",datascience,2124,401
"Hi! I am a junior who switched to a CS recently (from an applied data science field). I am ultimately interested in either a SWE or data engineering/science role.

I am (incredibly lucky and grateful to be) deciding between two internships and was hoping for some input on what would better set me up for a career in SWE or data engineering:

1. Security automation engineering at a lesser known F100 company: in person (which doesn't bother me) in a smaller city that I'm not super interested in (but relocation/housing are covered which is nice), $23/hour (considering negotiating higher if possible - would hope for $26/27). I don't know much about the field, but am interested in automation and pipeline development (though long-term likely not in a security field).
2. Reporting/Data analytics at a large healthcare company (worked there last summer too, but different team), fully remote, $27/hour (might try to negotiate to $28/29 but unlikely to get that). This field is very similar to my previous major which I'm still somewhat interested in, but I was hoping to break more into a more tech/CS/math-heavy area of data if possible and don't want to pigeonhole myself in healthcare analytics too early on.

"Hi there,

## Share notebook with non-technical users (managers)

Sharing results from Jupyter Notebook might be a pain:

- you can't share notebook to stakeholders because they don't speak Python, cant run notebook by their own,

- you need to copy-paste charts into PowerPoint presentation,

- you need to rewrite your results to some web framework to make your results interactive.


Jupyter project offers a Voila as a solution for running notebooks as web apps. I found Voila a difficult to use, especially ipywidgets.

## Mercury 

I started to work on my own open-source framework for running notebooks as web apps. Mercury allows you to add interactive widgets in Python notebooks, so you can share notebooks as web applications. It offers a set of widgets with simple re-execution of cells.

GitHub repository: [github.com/mljar/mercury](https://github.com/mljar/mercury)

Documentation: [RunMercury.com](https://RunMercury.com)

## What you can build

You can use Mercury Widgets to create:

- [web apps](https://runmercury.com/tutorials/web-app-python-jupyter-notebook/), reports, dashboards,

- [presentations](https://runmercury.com/tutorials/presentation-python-jupyter-notebook/) - use widgets to interact with slides, slides are recomputed during the slideshow

- [websites](https://runmercury.com/tutorials/website-python-jupyter-notebook/) - share notebook as static HTML (with code hidden), 

## Features

Unique features that make Mercury different than Voila or Streamlit

- simple re-execution of cells after widget update,

- all input widgets are displayed in the sidebar, your app layout is ready,

- authentication to control access to notebooks (coming soon),

- easy file upload and download in notebook,

- export result to PDF or HTML with button click.


## Future plans

I would like to provide a cloud service for notebook deployment. You will upload notebook and it will be available as web app/website.

I’m open to do internships or a new grad program or any full-time position as a data analyst, data scientist, data engineer, machine learning scientist/researcher (any of those positions work for me). It’s actually my first time applying/working in industry and I just have a couple of questions:

1) What is/are some thing(s) that you did that you learned not to do? (e.g., mistakes/pitfalls that should be avoided)? Or perhaps things that you regret not doing?

2) My second question is in terms of applying for jobs. I have heard from some colleagues and have read from some posts in this subreddit that job hunting can be rough. For example, one has mentioned how he applied for 400+ jobs and still no success. I currently have applied to I think around ~70 already and I’m starting to see what he meant. I only heard back from a couple of companies but all of them rejected me (actually, one company that I applied for reached out to me and said they wish to proceed with my application, but I also found out through my research that the company was a bit shady with their practices, so I’m glad I didn’t decide to respond to them and just dodged the bullet). But idk, maybe the resume I’m using has some problema. I’m using one and only one resume (2 pages) for all positions (and companies) I’m applying for (I also have a CV, which is a longer version of my resume; 7 pages). I also thought and I fear that my resume has become overloaded (full of loaded text and description with very minimal margins and is very tightly compact). I put a short professional summary of myself and then my education. I also have 4 publications, 4 (top) side projects, and 4 (related) course projects, each with around 2-4 bullet points of descriptions (bolded significant and relevant words). I also include my one and only internship experience (insurance industry) and description in bullets and my current job experience as a teaching assistant for big data science courses. I also included volunteer works (apparently, employers here in Canada tend to look at those as well). I also added the Technical skills. Idk if there’s anything I could improve on it? Am I overloading it? Should I reduce to 1 page? 

I highly appreciate your time, thanks so much!

P.S. I’m from Toronto, Canada. Ideally, I would want to stay here and find a job here. If not and have to relocate, US is also fine.

"I’ve been working at a company for about a year and a half, the team team I’m on is supposed to be integrated with other teams cross functionally but the director of my skip level team is painfully bad at…well…directing. There doesn’t appear to be any process to how teams are supposed to work together. He’s produced no guidance or overview or set his priorities for work. 

What results is that an escalation will be forwarded to some teams to work on individually while other teams find out about an escalation only through rapid fire messaging or through another team. 

Teams duplicate work because nobody is placed in charge to manage the escalation. So multiple reports are generated on a single escalation and nobody really knows who the stakeholders are nor have they worked with them in any capacity. Basically everyone tries to answer any possible questions because no specific question is asked. 

I’m confident this issue is at my skip level and not my first line leader who is often as confused as I am about how to proceed when someone just says “do data science” with no meeting or planning or scoping of any kind.

I'm more concerned about the ""soft"" skills of people handling and even things like keeping egos from clashing and optimizing team performance.

 I want to help the team be their best, by helping individuals show their strengths, and sort of get out of their way (though I will also become the main contributor to this project: it is a very small team of programmers, so I'm not just a project manager by any means). 

These are *really* good people I'll be working with and for. I want to do a good job helping create a great product, and not blow it because I didn't handle interpersonal dynamics well. The reason I'm asking here is because I have seen teams go down some very dark and painful paths (e.g., psychological hell for months on end), because subtle psychological incompatibilities became amplified and mutated into monsters when not addressed. I really don't want that to happen I'd love to be part of a happy thriving team that's excited to get shit done!

"Hello World,

I hope you can help me here.   Based in London, live here and work here.

Quick summary about my career.  Been working in human resources for the past ten years and have worked in particular niche of human resources, which is compensation and benefits.  My role has been a compensation analyst.  I've done this role at the same level and have had the opportunity to work in different companies and in different sectors.  The part that appeals to me is the data side of things.  I enjoy working with data, creating insights, visualisations.  It allowed me to work with a lot of employee data and doing a lot of analysis ranging from  analysing salaries, gender equity analysis, bonus modelling, automation in processes and more.

Along the way, I got technical skills in Excel (advanced user, building macros), Power BI, and Python (last year i've learnt quite a bit ranging from Pandas, matplotlib/seaborne, web scraping, SQL and databases, selenium)

Now would like to do a lateral move and move into data science.  I have the following questions:

1.)  Has anyone here done a move from a differnet field and went into data science?  If so, what was the transition like and how did you get your first data science role?

2.)  What tips would you give to get into the data science field?  (e.g what other skills need to be learned, create a project portfolio, recruitment agencies, a network I can join that can help in finding opportunities?)

"Hello everyone. At my job (consulting) my team was asked to improve the monitoring of project advancement at the client's firm. In particular, they struggle with defining a milestone baseline at T0 and sticking to it without rescheduling. They would also like a theoretical economic advancement of the project to compare against the actual technical progress (mainly SW development projects). 

The manager proposed a ""per-case"" approach, which means defining with the client's Project Manager at T0 the most probable date of each milestone and the project duration, while estimating a corresponding economical effort for each milestone, to be divided for each milestone duration.

Since we actually have last year's reporting data on this process, I thought about proposing a more statistic-based approach. 

I would like to create a model where for each Project Manager/Project we create a ""standard baseline"" based on the historical data, and a ""deviation model"" based on the project/task rescheduling pattern of the past year. In my mind, this would allow the generation of all the project baselines in a more structured way than discussing every single milestone relying only on the Project Manager's gut feeling. This would also allow some ""rolling"" adjustments to the deviation model while every monthly monitoring cycle is closed.

Now, I am just starting to look into linear regression algorithms, could this be the right approach for this project? I kinda cannot figure out how to build the database for this. I do not have a data scientist in my team to brainstorm together, unfortunately. My main concerns are:

1- Not all of last year's projects did not start at T0, and they do not have the same duration. I take that to properly analyze the data I would need to fill those NaN with something, but I can't really stretch the time series or put the average value, since it's a % progression from 0 to 100%. Would it be of any help if I, for a start, reset all the projects as they were starting at T0?

2- Some projects from the past year are still rolling, so I do not have all the data points up to 100%, can I still make a somewhat accurate estimation?

3- I imagine the dataset defined by a column for each project, with on each row below the % of advancement for each monitoring cycle (1 month). I guess this is correct, but how do I fit in the same structure also the ""deviation"" for each project?

4- I take that once the problem has been framed, it would still be needed a lot of coding and testing all the hypotheses, but I can put a small team with some python knowledge to work on that. What are the steps I cannot miss in order to deliver a sound baseline/deviation forecasting model?

5- I looked for some literature examples exactly on this use case, but I couldn't find much. Can you point out some papers that I can use for learning the methods and the critical steps?

"How should I go about Forecasting Estimates.

I’m building a custom forecast using QuickBooks &amp; Hubspot’s API

My X axis of my chart consists of the following data:

Actual: Revenue
Expected: (0.5 x (Deal Probability x Deal Value) + Revenue) + (
New: Deal Probability x Deal Value

My Y axis is each month.

My question is I want to track revenue from closed deals, but the final 50% of the closed deal, as you can see I’m tracking the first 50% in expected. 

I thought about using estimates as that income is guaranteed within the next 2 months, but invoices do not exist for them yet. So for income where I know is guaranteed for X day of the month, this isn’t tracked in quickbooks.

The issue with using estimates is as soon as the invoice is made, the estimate total doesn’t go down. So I can’t go the estimate route because it’ll create duplicate income.

I suppose i can track this manually? But the whole goal is automating this.

Any ideas? Sorry if I explained poorly :/

"I’m pursuing a MS in Applied Data Science at a reputable STEM-focused university, which prides itself on working closely with employers and industry professionals when crafting their course plans. I also chose this school because it was the only one near me offering a DS program without having to go online. This is the 3rd year of the program being offered. 

The professors are great people who seem to thoroughly enjoy what they do, but the program itself is turning out to be a haphazardly slapped-together shitshow. Most of the courses are lumped together with the undergraduate CS courses, and as such the times which they are held aren’t conducive for working adults who don’t live on campus, despite the school claiming they would be. And while the professors are great, none of them seem to be on the same page with what the program is intended to accomplish. When starting the program, we were all told that everything will be done in Python. A couple terms later when I’m just starting to delve past the beginner stages, another professor decides he wants to teach in R. In the database class, the professor is hellbent on typing out SQL queries on a Word document rather than actually implementing them in Workbench. I was also forced to take a “Management Science” course to fulfill an elective due to limited course availability for one term, which revolved around optimization problems in Excel, which was basically a repeat from undergrad. 

A positive to come out of the program is that I was able to land a supply chain analyst role upon graduation due to the school’s industry connections, which is good since I worked in supply chain previously, so I can apply DS principles to a domain I know a little about. I was also fortunate enough to be able to use my GI Bill for the program, so I’m not out any money.

"As the title says, I've been in my first data science role for about 6 months. This post is mainly just to ask whether what I'm experiencing is common within professional data science. 

The main crux of my role is deriving datasets from raw data. It might be as simple as creating flags based on the value within a column or it could be a little more involved with summarising and cross-tabbing. The thing is, once I've created the dataset and it's been QA'ed and sent off, I don't actually do any analysis to it. I don't look for insights or interesting features or make predictions, perhaps the only EDA I do is to look for anomalies to make sure something hasn't gone wrong in the processing. 

My first proper project in the first few months was to create one such dataset, once that was finished I was then put onto recreating an existing dataset using different and more reusable data sources. Our department has a data engineering and data modelling team which also derive some datasets but I've never had to use them as I never seem to do any actual analysis. 

Basically, is this normal? I anticipated that lots of the job would be data cleaning and manipulation, but I seem to be doing the bulk of the actual coding and putting together of the data without then getting to do anything with it. I don't think I've even made a histogram yet. 

What is frustrating is that there's a fairly sizeable bonus to salary offered if you can demonstrate that you're using advanced data science or analytical techniques, however I rarely (if ever) get the opportunity to actually use them therefore I doubt I'll be able to get the bonus.

I'm weighing up my options. I'd like to stick around for at least a year and there's the potential to go up to senior data scientist. What I'm missing currently to go up to senior are the usual soft skills like interdepartmental communication, managing projects, time management and decision making. All things which I would build up if I stick at this job, what I'm concerned about is how my actual data science projects would translate to applying to other companies in the future.

You  can try to fine-tune your own text generation model for that (like  GPT-3, GPT-J, etc.) but results are sometimes disappointing as the  fine-tuned models tends to forget some of the facts mentioned in the  dataset...

At NLP Cloud, the  strategy we prefer is about mixing semantic search and question  answering. Here is a quick article about how to do it:

[https://nlpcloud.com/question-answering-on-domain-knowledge-with-semantic-search-and-text-generation.html](https://nlpcloud.com/question-answering-on-domain-knowledge-with-semantic-search-and-text-generation.html?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=h5d7a9cc-3816-11ed-a261-0242ac140006)

As far as we know, this is the best way to get both a fluent and user friendly answer while being very accurate.

I would love to hear your thoughts on this. Can you think of a better strategy for question answering on very large documents?

cross_val_predict yields the actual predictions from the CV. E.g., if there are 5 folds, then the output of each sample is its predicted value when it was in the test fold (trained on the other 4 folds of data).

cross_val_score calculates the predictions in the exact same way as cross_val_predict. However, it does not return the predictions - only the averaged score across the test folds.

"I've been self-studying data science for a while now and am getting to the point where I want to start applying to data science/data analyst jobs. I have a somewhat abnormal background in that I have a BS and MS in physics and I worked as an optical engineer for 3 years. 

I've been spending the last 6-8 months getting myself comfortable with the basic things one needs to know to be a data scientist. Python, SQL, statistics, classification, regression, etc.... you get the point. I feel like I could study forever and not be prepared for interviews, though. 

I guess my question is, what do you expect in interviews when you know someone doesn't have the typical background? How would you prepare if you were me? I'd really love to get a job that recognizes that I have a strong quantitative and scientific background and is willing to invest in me as an employee... am I being unrealistic thinking I could find a job like this?

I feel that I have been a strong performer when I was an optical engineer/optical physicist (my coworkers and supervisors have told me as much), but I don't really know if it is appropriate to bring up those projects in a DS interview or if I need to give myself a substantial data science project and just stick to talking about that in an interview.

"Hello!   
I'll try to keep this short and to the point.

I am preparing to re-enter the field of ""data science"" following a 2 year stint at a startup where I was fulfilling more of a product design and business development role. I found that work to be very interesting and rewarding but at the moment, I'd like to go back to developing a harder skill set.  


Some background on me.  
I have a bachelor's in business management (2013) and completed a Ms Stats/Data Science program January 2019.  
I worked 2+ years as a data scientist at a large US tech company (supply chain). This work was mostly boring and not consequential, so I left for something more exciting.  


So as I begin to prepare to re-enter the data science field, I'm curious how much has changed and how I can best prepare myself..

I have questions but I am also seeking general anectdotes and advice.

* What is the typical tech stack in a data science team these days?
   * In my previous role I was modeling in R and Python depending on the use-case
   * Some light dashboarding
* What's ""up and coming""
   * Besides ""AI"" coming for everyone's jobs
   * What's new that is making folks more effective?
* Have technical interviews changed? What's the status quo?
   * I've previously ""gotten away"" with offers that didn't require tech interviews but I see that as a flag now
* Suggested material for re-familiarizing myself/catching up?

"One very useful benefit I found with ChatGPT for job seekers is asking it to serve as a Hiring Manager that asks you questions for the specific role you're interested in.

To help it guide you, you need to provide it with some context based on the job description. For example, you list out the job description to ChatGPT and say that you want to be asked questions on causality and experimentation.

Here's the response from ChatGPT based on the following prompt I provided it after sharing the job description:

===**PROMPT BY ME===**

I would like you to be a hiring manager. I'll be soon interviewing with you for a Data Science role, and you are going to ask me questions related to causality and experimentation. What are the questions you would ask to test me knowledge?

**==RESPONSE BY CHATGPT===**

Sure! As a hiring manager for a data science role, I would like to assess your understanding of causality and experimentation. Here are a few questions I might ask:

1. Can you explain the difference between correlation and causation, and give an example of each?
2. How do you design an experiment to test a causal hypothesis?
3. How do you ensure that the results of an experiment are valid and reliable?
4. Can you explain the concept of confounding variables, and how do you control for them in an experiment?
5. Can you explain the difference between a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and an observational study?
6. How do you measure the impact of a treatment or intervention in an experiment?
7. Have you worked with any causal inference methods such as propensity score matching or instrumental variables? Can you give an example of when you used them?
8. How do you determine which variables to include in an experiment, and how do you avoid overfitting in the modeling process?
9. Can you discuss any challenges or limitations you have encountered in designing and conducting experiments, and how you overcame them?
10. Can you give an example of a real-world scenario in which you applied causal inference or experimentation methods to solve a business problem?

You can ask ChatGPT to provide a summary answer for each. However, I would highly recommend you validate the answers by researching as well as ChatGPT can give confident, wrong answers.

I originally was planning on going into software development however my last semester I took my university’s intro to machine learning course and really enjoyed it and decided to pursue data science. 

So far I’ve just been going through online resources to familiarize myself with the field and how to make myself a more suitable candidate. Learning the basics of data preprocessing, wrangling, and EDA. I did an introductory course on PyTorch to learn more about ML frameworks and modeling.

I know the next step is to start building a project portfolio but I’m at a bit of a cross roads. From what I’ve read it’s pretty difficult to get an entry level data science job right out of college and you really have to have an outstanding project portfolio or resume. Although I went to a really good public university, I made a lot of mistakes, my gpa is subpar, I only have one front end dev internship under my belt and I haven’t started a project portfolio besides basic EDA and modeling to learn. 

I really want to enter the work force as soon as possible and don’t know if I have the time to build an impressive project portfolio to get an entry data science position. The advise I was given was to start applying to data analyst positions and gain experience for a year or two. In the meantime to be doing independent projects and might even do a one year masters program with a focus in ML/DS and then transition to data science.

\------BL  
\------DAS AUDIO  
\---MICROPHONES

My issue is that when filtering by AUDIO, for example, there are no results from ANYTHING below it... only things that are in that top level category.

We tested the same scenario in our local environment and found that if we search parent subject (Top level), the child LO is not returned in the search results.  
This is as designed, this only searches using the subject select and does not include child subjects.  
As a workaround, when the subjects are set up in training, you can also add the parent and child both subjects so that both will be displayed in the Search.

I'm 95% sure this is a dumb answer, right? As in, if it wasn't going to be included in the search for the parent, then it's not really a nested ""child"" subject... it's just a... completely different subject.

"I had an interview with an interesting question. I had a solution that would have worked which would have required a recursive query, but the interviewer said there is a simpler solution. I was wondering if anyone here could figure it out

Four column table:
1. UserID- unique string
2. Device Id- unique string
3. session_start_time- timestamp
4. session_end_time- timestamp

It's possible for users with different deviceIds to have overlapping sessions. 
The goal is to have one row per user per overlapping session.
So let's say that I have a session on my phone from 10:30-11:30, and on my computer from 10:45-11:45. The goal would be to aggregate this into a single row:
    UserId|session_start|session_end

My strategy was to use a lag to bring up the next row in order to be able to compare them- and the recursion would have been required in cases where a user had 3 or more overlapping sessions. But according to the interviewer, there is a different solution (I asked and did not get the answer).

I am a fairly new working professional in Software Engineering, who was recently laid off.

The thing is - I have some experience working within both the domains, and also have a couple of publications in NLP. 

While I completely understand that the final decision is going to be upto me, I had a few questions for people here - especially for the people who have made a switch from data engineering to data science. 

1. How easy was it for you to switch?
2. Why did you make the switch?
3. What is something that you really love and really hate about the 2 domains?

"TLDR: making stuff go pew pew algorithm development vs traditional data sci in health insurance

Offers acquired! Woo hoo! Now the dilemma of choosing one. They both pay around the same, so that's not a factor here.

The first is an algorithm development intern position at a well known DoD contractor. It's definitely more math stat oriented. In the interview, I talked a lot about my schoolwork in Computational Stats I and II using Kalman Filters and stuff we did with MLE. I'd be making things blow up.

The second one is a more traditional DS intern role in health insurance. I gave good answers on the details of XGBoost and wrote queries in SQL to identify who was overcharging for certain meds, etc.

I don't really have an interest in either of these fields to be completely honest with you. With this algorithm development job, it does seem fancier, but I feel like I'd be pigeonholed to working in defense because of it. I imagine interviews later on would go along the lines of:

 *""What did you do at \_\_\_\_\_?""* 

*""Well I used a bunch of crazy algorithms to make heat seeking missiles!""*

 *""Ehh that's not really what we're looking for. Thanks!""*

The second job in health insurance seems like a complete tornado slip slide into corporate mediocrity. Health insurance seems just as scummy as defense in my opinion.

Although the low gpa is a concern, my profile fits much better for Data Science but isn't bad for top BA programs that do have DS courses in curriculum as well.

Google and Microsoft plan to incorporate AI into their search engines to change how people use the internet. Microsoft has announced that AI will soon allow conversations with its software and search engine Bing, while Google has announced similar plans.

As the most profitable software business is searching both companies are trying to take advantage of AI to rule the search engine market. 

[**Integrating the generative AI means a fivefold increase in Computing power &amp; carbon emission.**](https://www.wired.com/story/the-generative-ai-search-race-has-a-dirty-secret/)

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into search engines could lead to a significant increase in the amount of energy that tech companies require and the amount of carbon they emit.

Training these models takes a huge amount of computational power, but only big tech companies can do so because they have the resources.

* Potential to integrated into a larger website (perhaps as an iframe)
* Eventually put it behind a paywall (either the entire app or certain parts/data rows of the app)
* Be easy for a duo with pure data science / data viz experience, but no full stack development experience. Our skillset right now is more ETL to db, model development in python/R, visualization in python/R/Tableau/Power BI.

"As a brief intro, I’ve been stalking this sub for a while and in the couple years that I’ve started studying data science, your collective advice has enabled me to learn a lot of cool data science techniques, land data science internships, and improve my understanding of key math areas like linear algebra, probability, and stats.  I use this sub as a direct resource for learning data science so your advice is very much appreciated on my end.

Currently I’m an undergraduate studying Data Science at a top 10 school globally. Although I’ve felt that my major’s curriculum has helped me establish a solid understanding of the math, programming, and analytical aspects of data science, my major has generally been focused on predictive modeling rather than inferential modeling. 

At this point in time, I have taken four different ML/DL courses where I’ve gained a pretty strong grounding in classical ML techniques, core DL frameworks, and implementation/productization. However, although I’ve learned through classes and self-studying regression analysis and hypothesis testing, I have yet to take a class solely dedicated to inferential modeling as a whole.

This coming quarter, should I take my 5th ML/DL course to further establish my knowledge and approach to predictive modeling, or should I take a course solely dedicated to Applied Regression Analysis (name of the course) to gain a better grounding in inferential modeling?

TLDR; Should I take 5th ML/DL course or 1st regression analysis/inferential modeling course?",datascience,1530,241

"So long story short, my undergrad was in international affairs, nothing technical. I touched R a little bit but nothing extensive. I decided during the pandemic I was going to push to get a STEM masters to supplement my undergrad and I knocked it out. I really enjoyed it and I can use a ton of tools to develop ML solutions and deploy models end to end in Sagemaker. I’ve even become an OK programmer. The issue I have is many of these solutions and tools are black box. I can apply the tool to solve a problem but I don’t always know how it works and, being honest, there’s a lot of effing tools. 

I feel like I’ve got a good warm and fuzzy about what data science and ML can do and what it can’t but I find a lot of jobs will post their need for people with extensive education in quantitative skills, or vast experience with A/B testing which I understand but haven’t done extensively, or 6 years building solutions with Tensorflow. Thus, I feel like I might be wildly under skilled despite the degree. 

Maybe the industry is just so flooded now that DS roles really require a deep specialized knowledge because it’s so competitive. Seems like there are lots of PhD roles in industry these days. 

Would it make sense for me to go back and hammer out the math? Another undergrad? Another masters maybe? Push forward and do a PhD and lose steady income for the 4 years maybe more?

"First off, I am an international student based in South Asia, and I applied for data science masters programs in the US and UK to get my foot into the field. My major is in Economics and I made the decision to transition into this field pretty late (in my junior year), so I spent the holidays studying math and stats when everyone else was chasing internships (most of them failed due to covid19 though, so I guess I made a good choice). 

I didn't have high expectations when I applied to masters programs in both countries (since my major wasn't that quantitative imo), but surprisingly I was given an offer by two universities - one for each country. For the UK, I was contacted by the University of Oxford to study MSc (Master of Science) Social Data Science, and for the US I was given an offer by Harvard university to study MS Data Science in their engineering department. Now I need to choose one between the two programs.  

I did a lot of research, and currently here are what I believe to be the pros and cons of each program based on its curriculum and location:

&amp;#x200B;

Oxford 

 [OII | MSc in Social Data Science (ox.ac.uk)](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/study/msc-in-social-data-science/) 

Oxford's program is not as rigorous as standard MS Data Science programs (see the 'Social' part) because their curriculum focuses on applying data science in social science contexts, and the program lasts for 1 year, but it provides a lot of training on how to extract insight from data with a social science lens and I believe this will be useful if I wish to become a data analyst. 

The best thing about Oxford is that it is based in the UK, where you can apply for a 2-year graduate visa after graduation. This visa allows students to stay in the UK for 2 years to get some experience (such as internships and jobs) without needing to be sponsored. This option is very attractive for me because I literally have zero industry experience (no internships) due to having spent my time studying quantitative stuff in the later years of my undergraduate. Therefore, if I choose Oxford, I will apply for this visa and try to get some data analyst internships in the UK after graduation. In addition, Oxford's tuition is much cheaper than Harvard's (expected total cost is approximately $63K)

&amp;#x200B;

Harvard 

 [Master's in Data Science | Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://seas.harvard.edu/applied-computation/graduate-programs/masters-data-science) 

Harvard's program is pretty rigorous. It is part of the engineering department and lasts for 1.5 years. The curriculum is certainly more appealing than that of Oxford because I believe I can definitely learn all the quantitative things needed to become an entry-leve data scientist. However, there are some serious problems.

First, Harvard' program is extremely expensive. It is approximately twice more expensive than the total cost of attending Oxford. Very sad that there aren't funding opportunities, but I guess that's to be expected from masters programs in the US. Although my parents will be funding my studies (eternally grateful to them and I know many around the world aren't able to receive funding from their parents) it doesn't change the fact that it's a lot of financial burden. 

Second, it will be almost impossible for me to get industry experience. I know that many international students use masters programs to get a job in the US and stay there, but for an international student who has no prior work experience and no undergraduate STEM degree, I know that for such a competitive field it will be very difficult to even acquire an internship in the US, much less a full time job. And visa rules in the US require you to get a job in 3 months after graduating in a related field (for me it would be data science/analytics) or else you need to go back to your home country. Therefore, it is very likely that I will be returning to my home country with just the masters degree and no internship. I don't know if this will help me get a job even back in my country. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some things to note:

I am not desperate to stay in a particular country to work there - I am perfectly fine with going back to my own country after graduation. However, I really wish to get some experience (internships) before going back, so that I can maximize my chances of getting a lucrative job in my country. Also, I am aware that entry level data scientist positions are almost non-existent these days and everybody seems to start out as a data analyst. I'm fine with this, because in my country a masters degree in a quantitative subject is required to become even a data analyst, much less a data scientist.  My current career goal is to be hired as a data analyst in a large company for my first job. Currently, Oxford's program is more appealing in that regard due to its lower costs and the opportunity to get some internships in the UK after graduation. 

However, my family and friends are are telling me to go to Harvard, because apparently the 'brand value' of Harvard exceeds that of Oxford's in our country, on top of the fact that it is more rigorous. Also they are making it sound like I can just go for a phd if you can't get internships in the US after graduation (which I think is a bit ridiculous because I'm not even thinking of a phd right now, and phds are not things you can get just because you want to). Yeah the sentiment here is a bit America-centric and they all prefer masters degrees from the US (I personally do not think Oxford's brand value is worse than that of Harvard's but oh well). 

&amp;#x200B;

Based on this, I am stuck in a dilemma. I really don't know which university to choose and both sound seriously appealing to me. For people working as data analysts or data scientists (preferably working in the UK and US right now) or people that know a lot about either of the programs, I would really appreciate your opinions and advice. Where should I go based on my circumstances?",datascience,6037,1048
"I love both data science and economics and am planning to take a double major in data science and economics at university. However, many people are telling me that the 2 majors don't go well together and that there are not many fields that would require economics knowledge in the data science industry. I would like to know the opinion of data science professionals on whether an economics background (particularly the mods with more mathematical rigour) is useful in data science in general. Also, I would love to hear if there are any data scientists working in the economics sector (ie. in the government). It seems that data scientist roles where economics actively comes into play are quite limited.

If you are a hiring manager looking for a junior data scientist role, would you hire someone with an econs and data science double major as opposed to someone who has a full data science degree and has taken more math and stats mods?

To give some context I also have a degree in electronic engineering and in my mathematical journey I have been very focused on model theory and logic, but lately after finishing my thesis I discovered that maybe the academia life is not for me. So I have taken two courses on actuarial mathematics and mathematical finance (which I enjoyed a lot). In engineering, I only liked the signal processing/dynamical systems/machine learning courses (which was one of the reasons why I decided to double major in math).

Right now, I feel that life as an academic is not what I'm looking for in life (specially in the country I live in) and that my love for mathematics has been more of a love for challenges and learning new things (rather than mathematics by itself) and I am very passionate about solving problems and mathematics has become sort of a drug giving me dopamine rushes every time something 'clicks' or every time I solve a problem. So that is why I am looking or advice in jobs that have a deep mathematical component that offers challenges every day and that evolves constantly (that also offers good payment and work/life balance). So far these are my options with their pros and cons:

* Quant /Mathematical finance: **Pros**: I love the deep and complex structure of the stock market and I feel that it has rich mathematical problems (stochastic calculus, PDE's, programming, etc.) It also offers great payment and looks like a very active lifestyle. **Cons:** I don't like that the main purpose is money driven. I have also heard that it is extremely time-consuming and that the there is not much work/life balance.
* Data Analyst/Data miner: **Pros:** I love programming. It also offers rich mathematical techniques and can be applied to a vast number of scenarios. I like that it is not tied to a specific industry because pretty much every enterprise needs data analysis in today's world. **Cons:** I have read that the day-to-day work is very different from the theory, and you end up being an advisor to the sales team on a company that expects you to do magic with their data. I also feel that climbing up the salary ladder takes longer.
* Actuary: **Pros:** Great payment. Great work/life balance (from what I have read). There are not a lot of actuaries. **Cons:** The need to take so many exams/certifications to increase salary/position. Work becomes very monotone and I feel that you are tied to the insurance market. Spreadsheet boring life.
* Programmer/software developer: **Pros:** fantastic salary (you can find home office work in USD). Already have experience programming. High demand for software developers. **Cons:** not very math-focused. It depends **a lot** on *what* you are programming. (I see programmers as digital construction workers), I would love some machine learning/math related programming, but I would die f boredom developing web-pages and that sort of stuff.

Can you guys share some of your experiences in these fields? How do you see each career in the future? Do you have any other recommendations for me? Thank you so much in advance. I really need guidance and different opinions before taking such an important decision. Cheers!",datascience,3623,614

"The description of this subreddit is ""to discuss ds career question"" so here's one question for the senior folks of this sub. I'm a Jr/Associate in this field and about to complete my 2 years at a IT consulting startup. Things like very less pay, management politics, unhealthy work environment, employment bond etc are making me quit this company.

1. Employment bond renewal during yearly increment.
2. Thee month notice period.
3. Need time for interview prep. Bad work life balance does not provide me with enough time.

"I’m currently a junior DS in my company (large org, property sector). I joined as an intern earning peanuts after my MS and just got made full time last month. Current package is more livable but well below market average. 

A couple days ago a recruiter from a company I was targeting post grad (e-commerce/retail) reached out to me. we had a call about an Analyst role opening up and they were interested in my profile. In a nut shell I got the impression that the job was primarily dashboarding. I mentioned I’m currently learning and working on ML problems and that’s what I want to continue doing. So the consensus was that there’s nothing that’s I’d be interested in now but as they build out their BI dept something will eventually pop up. 

Anyway, my heads been turned. The package they would offer is at least 2x what I’m making now. I saw the job posting in linked in yesterday and to my surprise one of the requirements is experience with ML! 

I’ve been with my current company for 7 months and it’s not bad but not great either. Boss is hands off, invests in courses and training. But I’m the sole DS in my team and don’t have a mentor. There are other DS in the in different departments, but due to some workplace politics we compete more than we collaborate. 

So to keep this post short, I see two options: 

A. Get a year under my belt with my current company and work on personal projects that will help a future application with Company B. 

B.  Call the recruiter back and say I’ve changed my mind after reading the JD and potentially move. 

I’ve had awkward gaps and lengths in my CV in the past hence my reluctance to leave so early. But since my foots in the door with my ideal company I’m not sure what to do.

"So I’ve just started a data science role at a big bank. I have almost finished studying my Masters in AI &amp; ML.

My first project at the bank is to conduct analysis on time series data, both univariate and multivariate.

I was tasked with trying SARIMA first on the end of term dataset before even looking at independent variables.

So I cleaned my data; removed trend, normalised, removed seasonality and got a p value less than 0.05.

I did my optimisation of my model, computational testing orders and got as good of a model as I could.

I tried testing by leaving monthly data off the end and trying to predict it with horrible results.

I know have a problem.

Assuming I haven’t made a mistake, this implies that this model is a poor fit for this data or that data is too volatile for this model and requires an alternative model and other variables.

"Hi r/datascience,

Apologies if this question is out of place (or gets asked super frequently). But I would really love some insight here. 

I (31 Male) am currently a carpenter - and while I do love it - I’m not positive that I want to spend the rest of my working life in it, for a multitude of reasons.

It was there that I was exposed to working with the data management dept on a few projects. While I am basically a total novice, it really interested me.

I’m married but no kids, and could afford some education (~$20k or under ideally) to make the change if that’s required. Otherwise, I wouldn’t mind diving in myself to start learning and find employment on the ground level if that’s possible.

"I 22m recently finished my bachelor's last year and have decided to apply for a masters in Data Science abroad which will take some time to prepare, which brings me to my dilemma. Some backstory: During the pandemic (apologies if I brought unpleasant memories) I started my self taught journey in data science, which involved watching a lot of tutorials, reading articles which somewhat gave me the jist of what algorithms and fundamentals (statistics, python,sql) are in the line of work. I watched some courses on statistics to try actually understand some concept like probability and especially harmonic mean lol, learnt SQL but never got to know how I'd use SQL to actually get data from a database anf use it for modeling. 2 years later, I honestly don't even know what am doing anymore, I wake up, log in to kaggle, find an interesting dataset, formulate a problem that might need solving (no matter how ridiculous it is) and do some analysis or build a model, and by the end of the day I contemplate whether what am doing is enough to actually land a job in the coming years. Don't get me wrong but I actually am very interested in the field.

With a all the blogs and multiple YouTubers around providing information on what data science is all about I end up questioning the very name of the field, what the actual **** is data science? Feels like I have been doing nothing in the past few years (jus 2 lol) I have made some models with which I am proud of especially a food recommendation system that I ended up presenting as my finals project..in addition, I read a lot of threads in the sub of what employers are looking for during interviews and realize that there's so so much I still don't fully understand....

"Hi all. 

Some context: My background is in engineering (not data science). I work at a manufacturing plant as a process engineer. Although my background is not in data, a bulk of the work I do in my current role involves analyzing large datasets to identify defect trends and rectify quality issues. I learned python, JMP on the job and use these for data visualization and statistical analysis.

The problem: my process involves making (cutting) multiple parts out of a single ingot. The parts are cut simultaneously. A single ingot can yield up to 7 parts. The process takes about 5 hrs. The machine records data of key machine parameters (inputs) every 5 seconds. So, each cut (production run) produces about 3600 rows of data from ~10 different parameters.

At the end of a cut, each part is inspected on a CMM for surface features. When I plot the readings of the surface features of each part from each cut on a time series graph, I notice that the surface feature readings tend to drift with time (variability between cuts). I want to know what is causing the drift. 

What I need help with: I want to know if there is a correlation between a certain machine parameter and the surface readings. I have 3600 data points from my input and 7 data points from my output compared over n number of production runs. This is a lot of data to deal with and it is very difficult to draw any conclusions from such a comparison. Is there a way to simplify the analysis? I guess what I am asking is what type of analysis would make sense in this situation?",datascience,1551,281
"I am solving a regression case for an interview. They gave a dataset with 12 features and 800 observations. I made a regression model in LightGBM and it performed really well in the validation dataset. 

The problem is that it is the only model I made and I would like to try more things to show to my interviewer. Some thoughts:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I thought about making a traditional linear regression to compare LightGBM with but the data they gave does not hold the assumptions of a linear model (i.e. residuals not normally dist.)
2. I thought about XGBoost but, as far as I know, its performance is similar to LightGBM but LightGBM is faster and uses less memory
3. Neural networks are not even considered given the size of the dataset

The instructions of the case say that the company is not so well interested in the prediction itself. They explicit say that the approach used to solve the task is more important than the prediction, especially because the data was randomly generated. In this case should I stress with making more models? 

Given that the instructions talk about the approach, I did an extensively EDA, stated all my findings, why I chose to use LightGBM, etc.",datascience,1186,208

"I've been building a project with the goal of adding it to my resumé but I'm not sure the results are anything to be proud of. Here's the Github repo: [https://github.com/miguelscarv/opinions](https://github.com/miguelscarv/opinions)

The project has to do with entity sentiment analysis, pretty much predicting sentiment on a document about a certain entity (like a person, company, product, etc...) using active learning. The data was scrapped with the Twitter API, so yeah the data is tweets.

I scrapped 500 tweets about Elon Musk and saved the 100 most recent tweets as a test set and the remaining 400 tweets acted as my training set. I then used a roberta model finetunned for sentiment analysis on tweets ([https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest)) and it got 57% accuracy out of the box. Mind you that this is a 3 class classification task.

The cool thing about my project is that it uses active learning to recommend tweets for someone to label with the goal of getting a better model with the least amount of labeled tweets possible. So using the training set I labeled 40 tweets and got my accuracy on the test set up to 66% - a 9% increase in accuracy because I labeled 40 tweets. Now my question is: is that good?

The model I used was already finetunned for sentiment analysis and I just further fine tuned it. the training loop looks something like: the active learning policy asks a user to label 8 tweets (this is the batch size) and once they are labeled it updates the model and uses that model to recommend another 8 tweets for a user to label.

The number doesn't really sound good enough to add to my resumé, but tbh I was surprised I got that improvement because there are a lot of tweets about Elon Musk that are hard to label, even for a human....",datascience,1879,309

So all that pretty much put me off software engineering and for now and I'm considering data sceicne cause I think it'd be better suited as it is more math heavy and it has applications instead of developemnt of some tool.


However reading this subreddit, tells me that coding is absolutely essential part of you're job and basiclly you are just becoming a software engineer. How much of this is true? How much of your time is spent really doing the basic software development coding tasks like debugging and what not and how much of you're time is spent really ""analyzing data""?


I really want to get a clear picture of really HOW software works here.


TLDR: I like the math, data and logic but hate the entire software development process(debugging optimization etc) only see software as a tool towards a greater goal. Not the kind fo guy who develops apps or does hackathons on his free time. I would much rather be a Quant then a software developer.

"Hey Everyone,

I am currently doing an analysis of how an increase in mentions, tags or comments of a social media brand has an impact on website traffic.

I am using the Pearson correlation coefficient to do this. 

However, due to the nature of Social Media, I can see that it sometimes takes up to two days for the increase in mentions, etc. to have an impact on the website traffic.

Is anyone here aware of a model that takes time lags between two variables into consideration?

Or maybe even some technique that is directly used to measure the impact of social media engagement to website traffic.

"So a bit of background, I finished a PhD in OR in late 2020 and started working for large US-based retailer as a Data/AI Scientist. The job is great and focuses on optimization more than ML which is perfect for my background and interests. I make less than I could if I shifted to a silicon valley company, but the benefits are excellent, I have full time remote, and the work life balance is way better than when I worked at one of the FAANG companies. Bottom line is that I'm in no hurry to leave where I am. 

With that being said, I do want to move up into management in the next few years so I can run my own research team. I know I can do that much without an MBA, but I don't think I can move much higher. I'm also not sure whether or not I want to. 

Unfortunately while I'm not currently sure whether I want the type of job that would actually require an MBA, now would be the ideal time to do it: my wife will be finishing her PhD soon and we'll probably want to start having kids in the next couple years once she has a stable (non-post doc) job so that won't be a good time to start working on a new degree. 

Anyway, if anyone here did an MBA after a PhD I would love to get your feedback on this. Was it worth the time/money? Was it necessary for the job you wanted?

"I live in Germany and am searching for a place to live.
The problem, I do not know where exactly I want to live. I know only HOW I want to live.
I know it will be the cologne/Bonn area with a 100 km radius or something. So a little bit of area restriction is okay.

But that depends on some factors that are important to me.

- does that City have a good train connection to Bonn?
- how often do you need to change the train
- how long would a car commute be certain specific areas. If train is not sufficient 
- how is the bike infrastructure in that city
- how hilly is that area? (Bad for bikes)
- which car sharing option does that city have if any?
- schools, kindergarden, etc.
- is there public transportation in that city?
- is there a swimming pool in a reasonable distance?
- How is the internet? (I work remote and my SO partially. Internet in Germany is a joke)

I guess more things but you get the idea.

I get that Ridge and Lasso penalize non-important coefficients as to reduce overfitting. That decision tree are comprised of if/else questions, that separates the data until it can predict a feature. That Random Forest involves creating a lot of different decision trees, in which the decision is taken by making trees to ""vote"". That boosting involves correcting previous decisions’ tree by fitting on their residuals. I get that PCA involves a dimensionality reduction, in the sense that’s the features are getting squished for explaining most of their variance (not really sure about this though).

But the thing is that I know only glimpses of everything. The math behind all those models were never my forte : I still have trouble to picture vectors, or matrices, for instance. I struggle to translate equations to graphical plots. I tend to disregard mathematical equations, if they involve too many symbols (like two sigma signs next to each other). I get the intuition behind most models, but I have trouble to vulgarize them, as I am not mastering them. Recent example ? I had a technical interview, and the recruiter asked me to describe in layman terms how a PCA works.

"I work in Computer Vision and other Deep Learning areas, and I've noticed a startlingly fast rise of really good Chinese CV research.

FAIR and Google and a few others still have some of the best work out there, but the Chinese are really really beginning to dominate.

Look at CVPR, out of the 2000 accepted papers, 90% have some Chinese origin. That's just by glancing and I could definitely be counting a lot of American or foreign Chinese immigrants, but it's at a minimum 75%.

My questions about this are:

1. Is there work really innovative? As far as I can tell most of their work is iterative improvements on existing western research, most.....definitely NOT all.
2. Will this trend lead to China dominating and forging ahead in AI?
3. They depend on US open-sourced libraries (PyTorch mainly) and hardware (NVIDIA, Intel/AMD). However, I do know China is investing in GPU startups and right now they pale in comparison to NVIDIA's best, but like everything coming out of China, it takes a few years before they become level with leading western tech. Also, PaddlePaddle is becoming quite a good library that can compete with PyTorch. Is the headstart by the West maintainable?
4. Is this going to become part of the cold war almost like a space race, but concerning AI and tech? I mean, it's probably inevitable, but my main concern is how does this affect what becomes open-sourced. I know licenses can be somewhat effective, but in a cold war scenario no one is going to enforce and adheres to license agreements
5. Where does this leave western (US/UK/EU/Japan/Korea) tech giants? It's inevitable that China, in 10 years, will become dominant in tech in many areas. How would that affect the marketshare, control and dominance of western tech?
6. What's going on with India? I had an NVIDIA colleague who claimed (5 years ago) that India was going to revolutionize and dominate AI research.

I suspect that they might be making me work for free. I got burned by a similarly complicated interview question in the past, where I diligently spent 12+ hours giving recommendations on the business use case, DNN architectures, etc., and got ghosted immediately after... also at a small startup.

Am I being too paranoid? Any thoughts would be welcome.

EDIT: Thanks all for the advice, this is why I come to r/datascience. There seems to be a consensus that stealing take-home tests would be exceedingly rare, and I appreciate the viewpoints y'all brought.

It's also interesting to see the dialogue regarding take-home tests in general.

EDIT2: for people commenting on what my DNN architecture take home test was, as part of the problem they LITERALLY gave me the full keras layer setup for an autoencoder model they were developing and told me the performance was poor and that they were trying to figure out why. It was clearly a project they were working on to deploy at one point and asked me to not post the code anywhere. I saw a few things I would change but mostly it was a fairly standard autoencoder.

"Hey All,

I just got my first job offer after searching for over 6 months after finishing a data science bootcamp last December. They are offering me an 80K base salary, with some sort of opportunity for a 3% performance bonus (I asked for more info on this and haven't heard back yet), 10 paid holidays and 10 vacation days annually (this will be prorated for my first year). Pretty standard benefits (medical, dental, vision, 401k, life insurance, disability, etc.) and some others I hadn't seen before: Hyatt Legal support, Critical Illness and Accident Insurance ( both Employee Paid), and a vacation buy plan where I can pay some of my salary to take up to 5 additional vacation days.

Some things I noticed that were slightly worse then some other companies I've interviewed at: The 401k match is a 2.5% match as opposed to a typical 3% match, and the 10 vacation days a year feel like a lot less compared to some companies that have 20ish or unlimited PTO.

For the above reasons I feel like I should try to negotiate a higher salary, however I'm nervous about doing so and the offer possibly being rescinded (I'm running out of savings and have a 5 month old infant). So I have a couple questions I hoped you all could answer:

Have any of you ever had an offer rescinded for trying to negotiate a better salary/benefits package?

Am I off-base at all with the vacation time?

Are there other parts of the package besides salary that I should consider negotiating too?

Thanks in advance for the help.

Edit to add more info: I live in northern Colorado, the position is fully remote and with an aerospace and defense IT consulting and IT services engineering company based in Cincinnati, OH. The current salary is already significantly more than I have ever made.

Edit 2: Forgot to mention that I undervalued myself early in the interview process and gave a salary range of 60-80K. So from their perspective its possible they may feel they are already giving me a great offer because of how I anchored think early on.

Edit 3: Since people keep asking I did General Assembly's Data Science Immersive (their word for bootcamp). I might write up a review on this at a later date, but overall I think it was good. I don't really know what other bootcamps are like, but GA provided a fair bit of job prep during the program and a good amount of job search/job rec support after the program. For additional background I have a BA in Psychology, an MA in Educational Psychology, and was 2/3 of the way to a Ph.D. in Educational Psychology (just had comps and a couple courses left before dissertation).

Edit 4/Final Edit: Holy cow! I did not expect to get this many responses/comments on this post. Thank you to everyone who took time to give advice and add your perspective to my situation. It really has blown me away how helpful everyone here has been, and it makes me even more excited to be joining this community!

I went back and forth on whether or not to try and negotiate some part of this offer, but I ultimately made the decision to simply accept it as is and plan to learn and grow in this position and then look at another job/renegotiate my compensation after 6 months-a year. I realize that the likelihood of them rescinding the offer is incredibly low, but getting an extra 5-10K or an extra vacation day is not equivalent to losing this offer after I've been job searching for over 6 months. I also have an infant to think about as well and I can't imagine the pain and fear I would feel if this got revoked. 

Yes I realize I'm making the cautious decision, but it feels like the best decision for me and my family right now to ensure that I have financial stability and an entrance into this industry. That is worth much more to me than a salary increase. 

It seemed like a couple of people were interested in hearing more about my background and experience with GA's Data Science Immersive, so I will probably do a write-up/review of it at some point in the next week or o before I start my new position.

Again thank you all for your advice, support, and congratulations it really means a lot to me to know this many people wanted to help me as I'm entering this field!",datascience,4197,760
"This question is about computational efficiency for natural language text preprocessing. Probably not the ideal sub for this, but I've struck out everywhere else, and I really need help. So here goes nothing...

# TL;DR

I need help selecting between `spacy` and `sklearn` for processing a huge text corpus. I ran a test to measure the performance of each, but the results were unexpected. Moreover, because I'm new-ish to the frameworks involved, I lack confidence that my test is completely valid. I'd really appreciate some guidance.

- [Code](https://pastebin.com/dBAW1rrD)

- [Results](https://imgur.com/a/dhJmNGi)

# Background

I'm doing a project that involves preprocessing 35 million Reddit comments. This is a pretty massive amount of text. So I'm searching for the most efficient framework to accomplish this with.

Currently, I am considering using either `spacy`’s `nlp.pipe` with several custom components, or a `sklearn.Pipeline` with a ton of regex-based data transformers. Since (1) `spacy` is optimized for text and (2) regex in Python is slow, I figured the `spacy` option is the way to go. But I wanted to test my assumptions before proceeding.

# The test

[So I wrote a quick and dirty script to do just that.](https://pastebin.com/dBAW1rrD) It seems like a lot of code at first skim, but it's actually not. It's very modular, mostly consisting of simple classes. Skip to `if __name__ ...` at the end to see the overall logic.

Anyway, this script defines what I *think* are broadly equivalent pipelines, one `spacy`-based and one `sklearn`-based, that simply remove (1) punctuation and (2) inline code `like this`. These pipelines subclass an additional class which actually carries out the test. So the script loads a ~7.5k-comment sample from this sub as a `dask.dataframe` (for parallelization), applies the same preprocessing 100 times using each pipeline, then averages out the results.

To be clear, my actual pipeline will do several more things than just remove punctuation and inline code. I only chose those for testing purposes, to keep my tests simple and to the point.

# Results

My findings (in seconds) are as follows, illustrated graphically [here](https://imgur.com/a/dhJmNGi):

|pipeline|mean|standard dev|
|:-:|-:|-:|
|`spacy`|13.49772|1.182763|
|`sklearn`|6.853291|0.127701|

Clearly, `spacy` was massively slower. This contradicted my expectations, and leaves me unable to draw firm conclusions.

Is `sklearn.Pipeline` with regex truly the more efficient framework for this? Or was there an issue with my test, or how I structured my pipelines? The latter seems plausible because almost everything the script uses is new-ish to me - `dask.dataframe`, `spacy` with custom components, and `sklearn.Pipeline` with custom transformers. So it may very well be that e.g., I'm just using `spacy` wrong, or there's something about my script that renders the comparison apples to oranges instead of apples to apples.

# Cry for help

In light of this uncertainty, I'd sincerely appreciate some input from anyone familiar with these frameworks. I'd also appreciate some eyes on my code, if possible, just to check that I've actually used everything properly.

Any and all input is welcome. Thank you!",datascience,3236,492
"Hi guys, I'm a 2 years experience MLE with severe imposter syndrome in need for place to rant/for advice

&amp;#x200B;

I accepted my current role 2 years ago out of desperation, just when COVID started and economies were plummeting, The company is a small data mediation and fraud management company. and I was tasked to kickstart ML/AI in the company, being the sole ML person other than my supervisor who only knew high-level concepts (mind you I was a fresh grad back then), I did achieve several milestones, and learnt a lot in terms of programming, software engineering and the ML stuff, but our ML feature never really left the presales stage, and the largest dataset I've dealt with was only 1mil rows in size.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today, I just searched up the job postings related to MLE and every company is posting freaking long lists of requirements, half of which I never touched throughout my 2 years. These include

\- Cloud Platforms (GCP, AWS)

\- Data orchestration and pipelines (Apache Airflow)

\- MLOps platforms (Kubeflow, MLFLow)

\- Containerisation (Docker/K8)

Not to mention, these MLE job posting pretty rare in the country that I work in, so I'm competing against many who, with a search of 'MLE' on LinkedIn, seem to have all the requirements just fine, along with 5 - 6 projects under their belt with similar years of experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I didn't really achieve a lot during my 2 years. Granted, I can't say that I have been 100% diligent, but I feel like there's only so much you can do being the sole person in the company working on ML. The ML feature that I've been working on from the ground up is indeed end-to-end (with multiprocessed model serving, model monitoring, auto model retraining, good explainability etc.), but at the same time it feel like it's lacking so much (no scalability with containers and clusters, not deployed in cloud, not using MLOps platforms like Kubeflow, not really proven in production). And I only really have 1 projects to show for my 2 years of experience.

&amp;#x200B;

That's when the imposter syndrome really kicks in and I start questioning myself. Can I really keep up? There are so many things to learn. Is this really what I want to do? TBH I feel like I'm also a bit sick of ML. I realised I don't really like analytics and the stats part of ML. I don't hate it, but I'm not sure that I have the passion to keep up. Or maybe I'm just burnt out temporarily, idk. The only part of ML that I find interest in right now is the software engineering side, productionalising ML, and computer vision in general.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I've decided to tender my resignation and start spending some time upskilling again. I'm currently looking at either Data Engineering or continue towards MLE/MLOps side of things. Even though I have no real experience/interest with DE, I'd figure that the job market with DE is relatively good right now compared to MLE in my third world country, and the job doesn't seem as difficult as MLE. I will have to learn some things from the ground up for DE though.

TLDR: Should I go for MLE again after patching up some of my shortcomings in tools/skills? Or should I dig deep into Computer Vision, maybe even get a Masters? Or should I give up and settle for DE?  
Also, are those job requirements above really realistic?

I appreciate any advice that anyone can give. And thanks for reading this huge block of text for a stranger on the internet.",datascience,3488,612

Honestly, the main reason I am switching from research profile to DS is because I wanted to learn the end-to-end ML pipeline, from data base to deployment in production for real products. Is that supposed to be an MLE job?

I am trying to keep an open mind and let go of my ego for having worked with DL models and looking down upon my friends who do linear regression in big companies. But seeing the comments here, I will be happy even if I get to do ANY ML at all.

"TL;DR using plotly for entire database analytics and making PDF reports to replace excel 

The context here is long, horrifying, and kind of funny, but this might interest some. So my company has a few hundred clients that load data a few times a year and pay for analytics reports. Ok fine, just use airflow to ETL the transactions onto an analytical db, do whatever regressions/averages/percentiles you need to, use Looker to pull tables and figures into csv, xlsx, pdfs, web dashboard, whatever.  But no - management keeps hiring analysts (me) to do the following: manually query SQL, copy and paste up to 8 different select statements into an excel doc that takes up to 45 minutes to open, then print tabs to PDF for as many reports as a client orders (the client only gets an analytics report as a PDF). The only programming project management hesitantly sanctioned were xlwings scripts to semi automatically adjust column widths and zooms to prettify margins and charts before auto printing to directories. 

Enter me. I suggested early on that a dashboarding tool could render analytics for the high throughput reporting products with lower resistance and better quality. People looked at me like I had three heads, especially the seniors. This is my first job so as a learning project I just slowly built a chunky plotly dashboard for my localhost. I also had to build an underlying ETL pipeline in SQL and pandas for generating csv views from the db and putting them into folders for each client. And since the original product was a PDF, I made a GUI for writing the dashboard tables and figures to stylized latex tables, and pdf images to be combined into a LaTeX PDF with my local installation of MikTex. This last part really stretched me mentally because I don’t really consider myself a front end person who knows html, css, or latex styling very well. Also it feels like plotly wasn’t really designed to programmatically render PDF reports but maybe Overleaf just oversimplified my past LaTeX projects.

Karnaugh maps come to mind to take this truth table and minimize it, but at least a few of my sources indicate that 6-input maps are about the maximum. The software solutions I've seen go up to about (8).  

So what software, algorithms, books, etc should I be looking into solve this problem?",datascience,1205,221
"I have a toy dataset that has a number of features. Some features have continuous values, others are one-hot encoded. I've set around 1% of each feature to be NaN to test different imputation methods with, such as sklearn's KNNImputer

The one-hot encoded features are treated as continuous values, which means instead of being assigned to 1 or 0, they're getting the average of their neighbors (e.g. if the three closest neighbors' values are \[0,1,1\], the imputed value will be .66).

What is the best practice for this? Snap the values to the nearest class (e.g. anything above .5 is rounded up to 1, anything below is 0)?  Am I only supposed to use KNN on continuous features? Very interested in hearing from others.

"Hello DS folks,

I work in an airline trying to train models to predict demand of our flights routes.

Regardless of post/during COVID times which are a total mess in terms of applying predictions based on history, I'm trying to find a general approach to use both local calendar (for example Jewish/Islamic/Christian Holidays which only relevant for specific portion of the population), and the Global/Gregorian which clearly affects the whole aviation industry around the world.Example: Chiasmas is always on the same Gregorian date every year while Hanukah may shift few days forwards/backswords every year ETC)Also, the differences between some solar calendar and lunar calendars (like the Islamic/Jewish calendars) is something to consider.

The current ""solution"":

I've got a manual ""dictionary"" (done by a colleague), matching between some dates in history (for example 2019 and more pre-covid times) and the current upcoming holidays of 2022/2023.I find this method super naïve and wrong as this process relays too much on a human ""hunch"" about which week this year resembles a week from the past. (Although human experienced in this industry could be helpful sometimes as data could get noisy, and some tasks do benefits the ""good enough"" solutions)

My question:

What is a more accurate and scientific method to deal with history data being inconsistent due to having more than one calendar which affects the business?

My first thoughts are having both calendars as features, and then to feature engineer some more constructive information regarding holidays (examples: days apart from next holiday/ is it a holiday week/weekend of any calendar).Hopefully I'll find a model which could find useful relations between the dates, so any date in the future will be more meaningful regarding its relative time in the year which clearly affects demand.

I wish to hear your thoughts on how to frame this task. Maybe how this is done in other industries/domains.

Thank you!",datascience,1980,313
"I'm working on a personal project, and I realise I may be in need of learning some data science.

The project scrapes product data from certain websites, and based on the product scraped, simpler versions of the product which can encompass multiple products are created. Lets say the product was 'Long Life Full Fat Milk' - this would translate to 'Milk', containing the different subcategories 'Long Life' and 'Full Fat'. The product itself is then added to 'Milk' under those categories.

Now imagine I have 100k products all of which need to be processed in the same way, to eventually create a database where a general term for a product houses multiple products under it. 

I've been doing this by hand, created a gui to make it easier, but the decisions are endless, it takes a long period to go through a little, and decision fatigue is real.

I can't think of a way to automate this - the decisions are heavily intuition based, sometimes the product name does not detail the full information about the item, so assessing a picture of the product is necessary, often there is branding &amp; unnecessary detail included in the product name which needs to be removed to translate it to a more general category it falls under.

I'm not very familiar with data science, currently I organise the data on a gui to make it as clear as possible to process it manually, but I honestly don't see an alternative approach to this. Can data science help me here, and if so, what do I need to learn?",datascience,1492,265

"I am working on a side project called `byod-hub` (BYOD = Bring Your Own Device) to let people pool multiple servers (they own) to form a DS platform based on Jupyterhub in minutes.

I think this might be useful to let small-mid-sized DS teams to better utilize their computing resources (e.g., if you have multiple GPU workstations and rely on assigning each one to people to SSH onto, this might be for you) by pooling them and providing a service like Jupyterhub on-top to provide a unified entry point to conduct their work using notebooks.

I would like to hear about the comments and suggestions from the community. Do you find this potentially useful? Or how should this be built in your opinion?

The general workflow to form such as platform is like this:

A control plane service (that only handles orchestration of computing resources) is first started on one computer (or it can be a hosted service):

```bash
$ byod-hub control-plane start

[INFO] The control plane is starting
[INFO] The control plane is served at https://192.168.2.100

# get the command to register a node
$ byod-hub control-plane get-join-command

[INFO] To join, run the following from a node
[INFO] byod-hub node join --url 192.168.2.100 --token 233asdasd343645gf
```

Then one can run the following command on their own server to register it to the control plane
```bash
$ byod-hub node join --url 192.168.2.100 --token 233asdasd343645gf

[INFO] Registrting node to control plane at 192.168.2.100

```

After that, one can visit the URL of the control plane `https://192.168.2.100` to start to use a [Jupyterhub](https://jupyter.org/hub) service to request Jupyter instances. The user workloads will be scheduled to run users' registered nodes.",datascience,1906,297

"For Seq2Seq deep learning architectures, viz., LSTM/GRU and multivariate, multistep time series forecasting, its important to convert the data to a 3D dimension: (batch\_size, look\_back, number\_features). Here \_look\_back\_ decides the number of past data points/samples to consider using \_number\_features\_ from your training dataset. Similarly, \_look\_ahead\_ needs to be defined which defines the number of steps in future, you want your model to forecast for.

Vector Representations of Data enable a new tool for Data Scientists to understand their data! For example, let's look at Twitter Analytics!

I want to understand how many impressions a Tweet will get -- an attempt to reverse engineer the recommendation algorithm, as well as the social context as a whole.

Twitter Analytics gives you symbolic attributes such as the Time the tweet was posted or whether the tweet has a URL in it. We can also engineer features from the text of the tweet such as whether it contains an Emoji, or the Word Count.

But this doesn't really capture the meaning of the Tweet and the high-level intuition that is difficult to describe symbolically. This is where Vector Representations come into the picture allowing us to capture the semantics of Tweets purely from the text of the tweet.

The other ran the previous simulation 1,000 times, calculating the ratio of heads to tails for each instance of 5,000 flips.  I had fun with that and I feel like it helped me understand the geometric distribution a lot better (as the first simulation resulted in a histogram with that distribution) much better than problems that just say ""assume this situation follows this distribution and calculate x, y, and z"".  So I want to simulate other experiments that model different different distributions, but I've been having trouble figuring out what types of experiments do that.  

I've been Googling  ""real life examples of exponential probability distribution"" and the like and I get plenty of results but I haven't come across anything I can easily simulate.  For example, one thing that kept coming up was that the time between eruptions of geysers supposedly follows an exponential distribution, but there's no obvious way to simulate that, at least not without knowing something about the geology of geysers, which I don't.  I even tried just finding an actual data set that follows the exponential distribution but didn't have much luck.  I managed to find data on the wait times between eruptions of old faithful, but it turns that distribution isn't even actually exponential, as old faithful is an exception to the general trend with geysers.  I finally thought to look for data on Covid case counts, since epidemics are one of the textbook examples of exponential growth, and I did find that, so that's something, but I'd still to do an actual simulation and I want to look at least one other type distribution of distribution, ideally by doing a simulation.  

Do you have any suggestions for relatively simple experiments I can simulate for this?  Or, failing that, where I can at least find data sets that approximately model such distributions?  I haven't yet learned how to scrape data from websites, as my course doesn't cover it, and I don't have the time to learn it on my own right now (unless it's actually _way_ easier to learn how to do than I'm thinking), so I'd need something where I can just download the data.",datascience,2873,488
"I've been in the data field for 10 years now and gained most of my applied knowledge from my first gig as a BI Developer who was lucky enough to build my own datamart from the ground up for the operations department. Two things that have stuck with me is first the concept of a data grain and what it means you can or can't do with your dataset. Second, for many reasons, is ensuring tables used for metrics are additive. This allows them to work well and accurately as picot tables or with other self service BI tools. Up until now these have been ground rules everywhere I've worked. 

I recently started at a data science shop and these two best practice concepts have been thrown out the window. I feel like people look at me weird if I ask ""what's the grain?"" And get rejected when I propose table designs that are additive. 

Does this stem from the fact data science uses metrics instead of facts &amp; dimensions? Wouldn't it make more sense to build a traditional data wearhouse and then build kpis off of that? 

For example let's say a single row transaction gets used in two different metrics the shop I work for would load that row twice, once with the first metric and again with the other metric number.

"Hi All,

I'm developing projects for a Github portfolio for a job search (lower level data scientist or experienced analyst type of roles for a stats background).  My current project is an R shiny app, and the single threaded nature of it and significant live data updating / computation processing has me looking to split things into server side code execution + SQL data storage + much leaner UI app.   

After spending a couple hours today exploring AWS + Azure VMs, it seems like most of the learning curve is just getting your IDE / software tools up and running + getting comfortable connecting to it -- most of the work seems like a 'setup once reading a guide, then promptly forget most of those details and work as usual over an SSH or RDP'

Based on that, I don't see too much value pursuing AWS VMs (really low memory available on their free boxes), SQL databases, or container hosting much further for my current project.  

Are there other services I should make a point of trying to fit into future projects?  

Thanks",datascience,1032,183

"My boss asked me to figure out what to do to minimize a target variable i.e. what features can I tweak to get the target down.  

It could be a supervised learning model, but it could even be a formula in excel (although I'd prefer python)

I would like to tweak parameters to get the number down (e.g. tweak the time of day, number of bankers currently working, temperature of room, height of customer, length of their big toe ... whatever.)

I was thinking a linear model could work - I get the coefficients and just tweak the variables. For example, *""lets see what happens when we reduce the room temperature to 10 degrees""*. However I have tried a linear regression model and the r-squared is horrific (it's actually negative).

"Hi all,
I don't know if this is technically an appropriate post but I started working in the health care system as an analyst 6 months ago and I absolutely despise my job. My manager who left a month ago had absolutely no data literacy or management skills. The two people who work with me closest got too busy to train me and are constantly bickering with each other. Every single time I have a meeting with them they make a huge deal out of what is a pretty simple meeting and instead of being constructive get way over their heads arguing. I'm constantly over explained concepts I understand instead of having a short meeting and going about my work to the point where I have started to avoid meeting with them as much as possible because they are all so emotionally exhausting to deal with.

"In the last few weeks I have been interviewing candidates for a graduate DS role. When you look at the CVs (resumes for my American friends) they look great but once they come in and you start talking to the candidates you realise a number of things…
1. Basic lack of statistical comprehension, for example a candidate today did not understand why you would want to log transform a skewed distribution. In fact they didn’t know that you should often transform poorly distributed data. 
2. Many don’t understand the algorithms they are using, but they like them and think they are ‘interesting’. 
3. Coding skills are poor. Many have just been told on their courses to essentially copy and paste code.
4. Candidates liked to show they have done some deep learning to classify images or done a load of NLP. Great, but you’re applying for a position that is specifically focused on regression. 
5. A number of candidates, at least 70%, couldn’t explain CV, grid search. 
6. Advice - Feature engineering is probably worth looking up before going to an interview.

There were so many other elementary gaps in knowledge, and yet these candidates are doing masters at what are supposed to be some of the best universities in the world. The worst part is a that almost all candidates are scoring highly +80%. To say I was shocked at the level of understanding for students with supposedly high grades is an understatement. These universities, many Russell group (U.K.), are taking students for a ride. 

If you are considering a DS MSc, I think it’s worth pointing out that you can learn a lot more for a lot less money by doing an open masters or courses on udemy, edx etc. Even better find a DS book list and read a books like ‘introduction to statistical learning’. Don’t waste your money, it’s clear many universities have thrown these courses together to make money.

Note. These are just some examples, our top candidates did not do masters in DS. The had masters in other subjects or, in the case of the best candidate, didn’t have a masters but two years experience and some certificates. 

Note2. We were talking through the candidates own work, which they had selected to present. We don’t expect text book answers for for candidates to get all the questions right.

"Hi r/datascience. I was looking for a bit of advice from the community here. 

I'm currently working as a scientist in the chemical industry. My main responsibility is building models to quantify chemical species or classify chemical materials from the data output from my company's instrument. The data has a large k (3000 columns) and can have small (15) to large-ish n (60000 samples). 

The data analysis is called chemometrics, and I've seen the field described as a subset of data science. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemometrics

I'd like to figure out if and how I could better advertise my transferrable skillset to a wider pool of positions and industries. I understand that I am far from a data scientist, but my base knowledge may be a good start. I've described my skills/job below, and I hope that someone could comment on whether I have potential to grow into data science, how I would advertise my skills, and what would be good to learn next. 

I ensure the data collected is good, and it is usually sourced from specialized data files. I have some experience pulling this data out of SQL databases. I then preprocess the data as necessary (cleaning, munging, feature selection), and then build models on the data. This usually involves derivatives applied across the data, normalizations (SNV), and smoothing. There are other mathematical transformations applied as well, especially in baseline corrections. 

For building the model, usually I use partial least squares regression for quantification, but I've also used support vector machines to quantify as well. For classification I've used knn, logistic regression, SVMs, and other methods as well. I commonly use PCA for dimensionality reduction before the classification methods listed. To optimize the method parameters, I usually use a cross validated RMSE or a confusion matrix. Validation of the model occurs with separate prediction sets.

To do the math, I've used python, R, and Matlab. I also have extensive experience with industrial software packages such as SIMCA. 

How would I go about rebranding myself into data science? I understand I'm not there yet, but I hope that my potential is there. Any advice would be much appreciated, and thank you very much for taking the time to read my rambling post.

Anyways, I am working on a project to take time series IOT sensor data to predict maintenance issues at a facility. I have a backlog of the time series sensor data as well as a log of maintenance calls from the same period of time that the sensor data covers. The goal is to take the sensor data and work order data and find correlations that can predict maintenance before failure. I have done a few data mining classification projects in school which are really my only experience in the field. My biggest hold up right now is how to format the data in a way which classification could be done.   


My current thinking is that I will associate a positive label to the sensor data if it occurs within a certain period of time(such as a few days) before a maintenance issue, otherwise it will get a negative label. Then I can run classification algorithms on the data to determine if the sensor data is predicting equipment failure. I feel like my thinking here is almost definitely not going to work, but I don't really know any other methods to try to complete this task.

"I know this cliche but this all started in a dream.

Long story short, i had a dream where I thought I saw my mom who died from COVID last year and asked my sister if that was really her.

So I woke up and kept thinking of it. I'm flip flopping if I want to engage in this as a long term project.

There are two big questions floating in my noggin:
1. Do people want this?
2. Is this technology possible?

By the title, I'm focusing this post on question two although feel free to answer the first as well.

So here's my thoughts on what would be required:
1. Learning the mannerisms and personality - I thought this could be done if we had access to Facebook API and recordings of video (home video).
2. Learning the voice - Videos exist where it could learn the voice but i dont know how an output would happen. I know it exists. (Remember the end of Rogue One where it essentially created Leia?)
3. Being able to converse and answer questions - Alexa and Siri exist. My question is, how difficult would this be to create from scratch? Would it be unfeasible without the help of an entire team and millions of dollars?

I'm sure there's a lot I'm missing. I'm sure this is technically possjble someday, but could this be done with our technology today? What else would need to be figured out?",datascience,1537,289

The reason for this post is because I’m in search of recommendations on how to go about this.

My first thought was to simply upload this Template File to my server and have the server handle any CSV files that I sent that way by having python open the template File, filling up the main table with the incoming Data and adjusting the Table size, then sending the resulting file back as a response.

That way I just need to set up an S3 bucket (My boss likes AWS for some reason) where I place my files, and then a lambda function that sends them as POST Request to my server.

I could just Recreate the whole process using either pandas, or even SQLAlchemy, but that would take a substantial amount of work and even then, I would still need to deal with formatting and making everything nice to look at.

I then decided to look into some Data Wrangling software, Trifacta for example, but I’m not sure if it will be able to perform the tasks that I require.

"Hi all,

I will soon start a project where I need to create a classification model from tabular data (both numeric and categorical). I would like to avoid the usual mess that occurs when you try multiple models in a rush (and we will be in a rush!) by creating a model archive on the cloud (S3 storage) where every model that performs decently gets saved together with its performance metrics and preprocessing/feature engineering details. While the model choice is relatively straightforward (constraints are no deep learning, no ensemble modelling) a lot of effort will be on the feature engineering part ( the data is highly imbalanced and with a 200+ features that will need to be selected, and engineered heavily). Also we expect much more data to come in the future, so 100% we will need to retrain the whole thing in a few months.

I was wondering if you have any idea /tool /best practice to ensure reproducible feature engineering and safe storage of preprocessing steps. The current options I am thinking are:

\-  Save every time the table of the preprocessed data together with the model (feasible but probably memory / cost intensive since the archive is all on AWS)

"So there's a strange and ancient kind of government out there called [sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition), where government officials were chosen by lottery. That's right. Straight out of a hat (or [Kleroterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleroterion)), we choose our politicians. I think sortition is very interesting as it sounds remarkably similar to machine learning principles. 

A modern implementation of sortition works as follows:

1. We randomly choose around 1000 people to construct our Congress to construct our representative sample.
2. The lottery Congress deliberates and acts otherwise like an elected Congress would. 
3. Every year, about 1/3 of the sample is rotated out and 333 new people are randomly selected to fill the positions.
4. The assembly votes using majority rule to enact proposals. 
5. If conservatism, damping, or some ""timestep"" reduction is desired, we can demand that multiple layers of assemblies repeat and validate rulings. 
6. With majority rule + multiple batches, sortition ought to iteratively solve towards a sort of optimal, maximal utilitarian preference of the larger population. That of course is the ultimate objective of this algorithm... to iterate towards maximum utility, or maximum satisfaction, of a jurisdiction. 




There's some cool analogies to consider:

1. Like with many ML algo's, sortition relies on using stochastic mini-batches. 
2. Like with ML algos, connected networks of sortition assemblies can break up the problem of governance. For example one assembly can handle proposal generation, another handles agenda settings, another handles judicial review, etc etc.

To start off, I'm not exactly that good at self-learning entire fields of subjects. I taught myself some Python and SAS (SAS was more learned on the job tbh), but never really to the point of doing my own Data Science projects.  


Okay, so I'm a 27-year old recent graduate in Economics (as of last year), and I have just started a (part-time) MSc in Econ, but with a specialization in Data Science and Numerical Methods.

"Extreme TL;DR version: SQL + Python or R with Python being significantly more popular.

Many people on this sub are trying to break into data science from adjacent fields. This was the case with myself too (didn't study CS or Statistics) so I'll give some advice specifically on a FAQ on this subreddit: what programming language(s) should I learn?

Just to preface a remark that will probably come, when I'm referring to data science I'm specifically talking about jobs that include statistical modelling and/or machine learning. I'm well aware this isn't the case for all DS jobs.

As mentioned in the TL;DR: **SQL, Python and R** will be your best friends. Initially you should strive to have basic knowledge of SQL, you can pick the rest up on the job plus deep knowledge of Python. R's tidyverse is easy to pick up and there's many people that start here and become reluctant to switch over to Python and Pandas hence why I suggest doing the inverse.

Now for the interesting part: **C**/**C++, Scala, Java and Prolog**. I'll start by saying this, you will most likely use none of these during your job as a DS, especially PROLOG, but learning (some of) them did give me tremendous value. I picked all of them up while in uni except for Scala. I want to emphasise that you should only look at these (except maybe C++) after you've gotten a deep understanding of at least Python.

Starting with C/C++, this one gave me the most long term value. Learning about stack/heap and memory management in general, especially without smart pointers, std::vector and other modern C++ constructs make you a lot more prudent when programming in *any* language. This rarely happens but just knowing them at an intermediate level allows you to write in Python/R, profile your code and call a C/C++ function to replace the bottlenecks. In all honestly, I dislike these the most (especially C), I learnt these in a combinatorial optimisation course (similar to data structures and algorithms). 

Scala is the only one in this list I picked up in my spare time. I learnt specifically about functional programming in Scala and why FP matters, stopping just before monads were covered. I wouldn't put Scala on my CV but my rather short time with it added some FP tricks into my toolkit. 

Java is ubiquitous in software environments, you will come into contact with it sooner or later so knowing some of it doesn't hurt. Object oriented code, proper use of data structures and design patterns are handy since they make your code so much more maintainable, structured and readable. All these concepts are transferable to Python too. This maybe a controversial opinion but don't underestimate how software engineery data science can really be depending on your employer.

Prolog and other logic programming languages are weird but fun. They offer different ways to solve problems and really make you a better problem solver.",datascience,2906,492

"In my opinion, CSV text files are great because they are so simple, you don't need any special software to open them and inspect or edit their contents, but the big drawback is that they don't record any information about the data types in the columns. Does anybody know any alternative formats which also record type information? This could be anything from a simply recording whether it is a number or string, to something more detailed.

Edit:

Parquet is great but I would like to find a format which is a human readable text format. While a file format like Parquet will be more suitable than CSV in many/most scenarios, in my opinion there are some scenarios where it is overkill, and you loose some advantages of a human readable format like CSV, e.g. being able to edit in a text editor, and track changes in version control.

Storing type information separately for example in a second CSV file or JSON or at the top of the file is a possible solution. The problem is that there should ideally be a standardised approach for which parsers have been written, so that you don't need to write custom code to parse the file.

The original idea was to determine whether we could detect signals from Twitter on what crops for farmers to grow based off tweets. We planned to create a sentiment classifier and run it on tweets containing keywords of different foods (apple, banana) over time, and then see if there was any correlation in those data with other time series data like food price indices.

I’m finding that it’s very difficult to find a very large set of Twitter data that is unlabelled for sentiment. Sentiment140 has a great dataset, but all the data is pre-labelled with sentiment so there’s nothing to predict.

Any ideas on novel ways I could alter this project that would have interesting NLP applications and also carry the spirit of the original idea (help farmers know what to plant with tweets)?

"I have hundreds of CSV files that each contain hundreds of megabytes of data. To create a class that inherits from PyTorch's Dataset the \_\_getitem\_\_ method must access a single sample at a time, where the \`i\` parameter of the function indicates the index of the sample. However, to perform lazy loading my class just saves the name of each file instead of saving all the data in memory.

So far so good, but I'm having doubts about how to access a single data in the \`\_\_getitem\_\_\` method, in my searches I found the following strategies:

1. In \`\_\_init\_\_\` save the number of samples that each file has, then in \_\_getitem\_\_ load the file with pandas and access the respective line. It is possible to know which file to access by the id received as a parameter, for example: having 2 files, where each has 100 samples, id 100 would represent the first sample of the second file, id 101 would represent the second sample of the second file and so on against. However, this approach has an obvious problem which is the number of IOs needed.
2. Perform the same process presented in 1, but store files in a cache as long as it fits in memory. This approach seems to be better than the first as it reduces the number of IOs as some files will be in memory. The problem with this approach is how the caching policy will be carried out, I thought of using something like \`dask\` to handle this, but \`iloc\` is quite inefficient according to the [documentation](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/dataframe-indexing.html).

"The title sounds bad, I know...  I'm not talking about collaboration in general team work or working environment, but a project-level collaboration: when multiple data scientists work together for one project. I found that it's so much efficient and well... peaceful when I take the initiative of the entire processes, from model scoping, coding, production to documentation. When collaborating with other data scientists for building one model, things can get overly complicated and political. Even splitting the tasks and deciding who does what are not easy.

"I'm aware that the Data Science job market is generally broken down into 3 fields related to use application of data (leaving out Data Engineer for the moment):

1. Data Analyst: Primarily focused on providing analyses of end result data, often using dashboards, or perhaps some statistical analysis. Traditional primary skills: Dashboarding, data munging and data analysis.
2. Data Scientist: Primarily focused on creating structure and meaning out of large datasets, often with a focus on using math, perhaps machine learning etc, creating novel predictive models etc. Traditional Primary Skills: Math, data munging, data analysis, machine learning.
3. Machine Learning Engineer: Focused on understanding and implementing machine learning/statistical models into software systems. Traditional Primary Skills: Software Engineering, some math, machine learning.

I went from a career of software engineering (C#, .Net, SQL web development) for 10 years,  did a huge pivot and became a medical practitioner (got a doctorate), pivoted back to data analysis, Power BI, and then into Data Science/Machine Learning exploration. Currently advanced to a relatively high level in Data Analysis/BI (head up a team of analysts, was COO as a smaller org) at a large health agency. But I've worked at a startup being the primary ""data scientist"", am familiar with machine learning algorithms from deep learning to decision trees to NLP (my current passion area), where I was integrating that stuff with their main software. Currently most of the ML stuff is do is side/passion project exploration, and while I'm far from creating ML models/frameworks on my own, I am very capable of picking one up from GitHub or existing packages and implementing it against novel often messy data in Python to pull out results and put it into practice either working into other datasets or even creating APIs etc.

So I'm this weird blend of a good amount of subject matter expertise, software development knowledge, BI/Data Analysis (though my stats/math skills I'd only classify as intermediate) and ML familiarity (mostly conceptual/application).

I feel like the best application of my skills is around application, taking data with underlying meaning, applying subject matter expertise and potentially leveraging ML models (NLP in particular) and putting that all together to present novel meaning in user understandable language.

But I feel like I get rejected for Data Scientist roles out of hand for lack of math background, for ML engineer roles for not having enough recent software/ML dev experience in particular on large software projects, and even from some Data Analysis jobs for not having enough of a robust math background (I was rejected at the last round of an interview by a senior DS for not being able to sufficiently describe a ""complex analysis"" I'd done and at another one for doing a take home project where they intended for linear optimization to be used, and I build a fully functional python program using heuristics within the 3 hours timeframe, including generating sample data). But I also feel like I don't just fall into the 60-80k a year drag and drop dashboard maker category.

Maybe it's just the artifact of being older (with now 20+ years work experience) but I feel like I don't fit cleanly into any of the cookie cutter data roles. Anyone have any thoughts on how to position myself and/or where I should focus? I have a hard time taking nitty gritty core math classes as I'm a very results/practical outcomes focused person so glaze over if I can't quickly see the applications (and honestly don't see many in the roles I've been in), though I've tried!

"Hi there

What do you guys think about using a ML  model to find statistical differences between populations? Let me explain my particular case:

I have a dataset of 56 cells (more to come) coming from 4 different patients (target variable) with different illness conditions, each cell has \~22 numerical features and our aim is to find differences among the patients (one being the control). Since looking for correlations between features and statistical differences become too overwhelming and tedious, I thought of training a interpretable ML model and use it to discover which properties have the cell of each patient, There is no intention/value to make future predictions. The 2 best performing models were Logistic Regresion and a Random Forest with AOC &gt; 0.9 and F1-score &gt; 0.9 (trained with the whole dataset an 10-fold CV). Afterwards I use the SHAP-values and permutation feature importance to see which features and values intervals are more characteristic for each patient. Although there is a bit of discrepancy between the order of the most important features given by LogReg and RForest, there is good agreement for the most important features at each case. I found this method superior to PCA since some features add little to the global variance but are important for a particular patient.

This is exploratory research, so the main question to answer with this approach is: is the good performing model a good way of finding whether cells coming from different illnesses are different?

What do you think about this practice? have you used it in your work?

"**TL;DR**: I am looking for datasets of which the attributes can be intuitively visualized (e.g. as a matrix. an image, a diagram, etc.) and are easy to individually select (e.g. by dragging over the matrix/image). What's more, it should be a dataset with which t-SNE has some difficulty, and of which some conceptual clusters are erroneously merged or separated in the embedding.

I am developing an adaptation of t-SNE — specifically [Linear complexity t-SNE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10817) — that allows users to manipulate embeddings on-the-fly, which hopefully results in more intuitive embeddings. To this end, the two main tools are the dragging and fixing of datapoints, and the altering/shaping of clusters by changing the high-dimensional similarities. As an example of the latter, imagine one apparent cluster in a t-SNE embedding of which the user suspects or knows it to consist of two or more ""actual""/conceptual clusters. t-SNE likely hasn't been able to separate them due to the discriminatory attributes (i.e. the high dimensions on which those conceptual clusters differ the most) being a minority within the dataset's high dimensions. In such a case, the user should be able to select all datapoints in this erroneously merged cluster in the embedding, select the discriminatory attributes in a visualization summarizing the selected datapoints, and let t-SNE adapt the similarities in such a way that:

\- inter-similarities (between datapoints from different conceptual clusters) are reduced by a lot

\- intra-similatities (between datapoints from the same conceptual cluster) are reduced very little

Now, I am looking for datasets with which I can demonstrate this feature. Suitable datasets have attributes that can be intuitively visualized and are individually selectable. Grayscale image datasets such as MNIST are an example. [Here is a premature version of my t-SNE adaptation on the MNIST dataset.](https://imgur.com/HWX4tcA)

I select datapoints belonging to digits 4 and 9 (which are always clustered together, even when reseeding), and then I select the attributes that are most discriminatory (i.e. the top portion of the 9) in the attribute visualization. After I let t-SNE adapt the similarities, those two clusters are less ""clingy"" than before. It doesn't work great yet, but it's still a work in progress.

"Hi there,

I've been working with Data Science/Machine Learning/Linear Programming etc for almost 5 years now. Basically the ""too mathematical for software developers/data engineers, too much code for maths/science folks"" category- you know the gist.

What I have noticed is that Data Science either gets treated as a traditional software development team or a BI team. Both of which I think are quite bad. Of course there's a surge of MLOps which is ""standardising"" shipping and maintaining ML in production, but it doesn't focus too much on actually developing the models. 

**Software Development treatment:** Here you lose a lot of flexibility in experimentation, research, model exploration and frankly the failure rate in Data Science projects is relatively high compared to other fields in tech (some things just can't be solved with ML/maths, or simply it is not worth it). Normal software development timelines don't make sense in most cases especially since you rely a lot on backend/data engineers/frontend/product before you even start a project.

**BI treatment:** Well you have 500 scripts, notebooks, analysis spread all around you. There's very little code reviews, basic software development procedures, it's basically the wild west 🤠. The infrastructure  gets built by people who have very little clue (or time) about any of this. Retraining, deployment are a nightmare.

"I’m currently interning as data scientist/bi developer(my manager claimed) since my internship is only 4 months I don’t have a designation on paper it’s just co-op intern. The work that I do however is data engineering stuff, as in building pipelines for processes on gcp. 


Long story short my experience with programming is not great, I’m an ai and data science post grad student all the projects that I did were basically me using python and applying statistical methods and trying out new things in python. Most of the time I didn’t have to code anything, I just had to find the right solution and the ones that makes sense to my project needs. 

I was pretty confident as I thought it’s about finding the code rather than writing it by yourself, now I’m paying the price. I get blanked out the moment I have to build logic and fix errors on code written by others in my workplace. I struggle with development and I don’t know how else can I’m prove myself, I know for fact that there’s no way I’m getting an offer for my internship as I’m very slow and everyone in the team is pretty smart. 

I understand that they have realized that I’m not on their expectation of performance so in the meetings they assign easy stuff and have a little laugh(I sometimes suck at those too) 


I thought they would be training me for the 1st month by introducing me to the tools and objectives at hand instead I was asked to read the documentation of Apache beam and gcp related stuff and expected me to work right away. It may sound like my team isn’t helpful but they are very nice people have helped me very much in learning and understanding.


So I don’t want to suck at coding so any resources will be helpful, I failed to find a leet code equivalent of data engineering and data science. Leet code does have sql but no where can I find-exercises related to pyspark apache beam google data flow and other equivalent cloud services such aws and azure provide. I love the fact that I suck at it makes me only want to learn more. So please any suggestions can be helpful. Thank you!",datascience,2076,380

"I have a project at work I'm working on and it's a recommender system for e-commerce plaform, but I am having difficulty because what I learned in school about recommenders was very high level. I've been a DS for a year now and know very little about them. I still sometimes confuse the scenarios for what collaborative filtering and content-based recommenders due to my lack of exposure. You'd think DS programs would put more emphasis on a field like this but many don't. It feels like there is a lot of secrecy with recommender systems despite it actually being a huge topic in the field and something that most seasoned data scientists will have to encounter at some point. When I speak to other data scientists, they aren't as quick to explain concepts for recommenders like they do others since it's so nuanced and specific to a situation.

Does anyone have guidelines for recommender systems scenarios, and requirements to implement them?

"Hello,

if got a data science problem and i am not quite sure how to solve it. I have a dataset about bus arrival times with the Target variable (isDelayed True/False). The dataset has a lot of features that could potentially predict a delay. Such as Weatherdata, Bustype, Weekday or Buffertimes and so on. The assumption is that often not through one variable a delay can be predicted but through complex interactions of multiple variables. To avoid delays in the future, it is critical to not only predict delays but to detect the different cases where delays might occur. So, it is critical to understand the difference of the variable combinations that lead to delay und such that don't. Also it is assumed that there can be multiple different scenarios that can lead to a delay. And so different classes within the delays should be distinguished. Do you have any suggestions how to solve this problem?

My Proposel to solve such a Problem goes as follows:

1. Use a feature selection method to derive important attributes from the dataset

2. Use a simple (or white box) supervised prediction method to find rules about when a bus delays and when not

3. Use a clustering algorithm to explain different scenarios of delays

My Question are:

\- Is this a valid methodologie for such a problem?

\- Is the second step a valid approach to find generalizable rules about the distinction between the two classes with high dimensional data, that sufficiently pictures interactions of variables and are explainable?

\- What could be a good algorithm for step two?

\- Is there a better way to solve this problem?

I hope I provided all Information needed. Thank you very much in advance.

Please refer to my username... Could someone please advise me on the best way forward.
In case it is important, the project outlined is not for work, it is for my own education.

**Problem**:
I want to take a set of structured data including prompts (company name, topic, and a few keywords) and generate an introduction paragraph for the company.  

I am interested in trying some of the open source large language models for this but I am unsure what is the most appropriate model or methods for this.  
  
**Question 1a)**: What is the most appropriate open source model (and sub-variant) for content generation as outlined above? I have seen BLOOM, GPT-NEO, and OPT but unsure which is best for my needs.  

**Question 1b)**: Given the answer to 1a) above, what is the most appropriate way of obtaining decent result to my task? Training a smaller parameter version of one of the above on some training data? Using few shot learning?  
  
**Question 1c)**: For few shot learning, is there any advantages or disadvantages to providing many prompt examples? Most of the time I have seen people use 1 or 2 prompts, but what if I gave 20? Would it improve the results, or just slow the whole thing down?

I'm also interested as a first step to download one of the smaller models to help me to understand how to use these models better. In the future perhaps using an online API like Huggingface will be better, but for now I will try locally.  
  
**Question 3**: Can anyone give me an idea of how much RAM some of the smaller LLM require? 8GB? 16GB? 1000GB?  
Are they able to run in a reasonable time on just a CPU? Just a single GPU?  
  
Is there anything else I am missing that you think I should consider?

"Basically the title

I am working on an image dataset with images from 17 classes... And I find myself doing mostly guess work of how many dense and convoluted layers should be there and results are not very intuitive. 

Like one of the answer that I read was keep increasing the dense layers till accuracy stops increasing but instead of increasing, my accuracy decreases with more perceptrons i add in a layer. It also decreases if I increase the number of hidden layers.

For less hidden layers, my model learns with abysmal accuracy I.e. starting from 0.09 (not kidding, also super embarrassing) it reaches around 0.55 at around 5th or 6th epoch and from then it increases at a pace of 0.02-0.03 increase per epoch (which is bogus as the accuracy on my validation data actually decreases after this point)

As for the data, it is highly uneven. With some classes having around 400-600 images while others have around 20000-30000. For training data, I am using 1000 images per each class (directly 1000 for classes that have them and augmenting through randomflips for those classes that have less).

1. Gain career flexibility. My PhD currently limits me to academia.
2. Gain some opportunities for freelance consulting.
3. Improve my capacity to build interesting datasets that could help my research and my students.
4. Develop a more visible skillset that I can publicly showcase (this is understandably vague). Long-term ambitions are to build more of an online presence oriented around an in-demand skillset.

**Ideas:**  
Some areas that I am brainstorming:

1. Machine Learning (Not sure what this industry looks like, so may be a naiive idea)
2. Data engineering (could help me build unique datasets, but would not have access to servers)
3. Web development
4. Data visualization
5. Data science (I understand that some of the topics above fall under this category)

Other than that, there are many other biases/paradoxes/pitfalls than the non-statistically minded might fall into. A decent list can be found here: [https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/23779/most-interesting-statistical-paradoxes/592495#592495](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/23779/most-interesting-statistical-paradoxes/592495#592495)

My apologies in advance for the rookie question (as I’m a physicist)!

I’m wondering if it’s somewhat easily possible to automate some content generation that I often must complete manually. For example, if I make an image or diagram to succinctly explain each of the physics questions at the end of a textbook chapter (ie, the text prompt), is it possible to generate mostly correct and similar images/diagrams for new input questions (assuming the training images are decently well standardized and formatted).

I’ve kept up with the latest research that’s come out over the past several months on similar questions—I believe there has been some success with Few-Shot classification. In any case, if anyone could tell me where to look (or quit while I’m behind), it would be greatly appreciated!

"I had some trouble with the softer side of data science when I first started as a data scientist. During my consulting days, I learned a lot about understanding and communicating with clients, which I want to share.

&amp;#x200B;

Below are some tips:

&amp;#x200B;

 ### How to adopt a business mindset

\- **Understand how the business makes money.** For you to add value to the business it is crucial to understand their revenue streams and how they make money. 

\- **Relate your work to a business KPI.** To measure the impact of your work, it can be very helpful to relate this to a business KPI. Not always possible, but if you can do it will help in understanding how you can generate value.

\- **Ask for feedback from your manager.** This is very underutilized. Asking for feedback makes you vulnerable, but it will help in understanding what your manager thinks is important. Plus, it shows that you are willing to learn (which is very important in business).

&amp;#x200B;

### How to manage time

\- **Prioritize tasks before analysis.** Before touching data, making a list of all actions you need to do will give more clarity in the process and help in planning your time better. Data science comes with a lot of uncertainty, which will take some of them away. 

\- **Use a data analytics project template.** A document where you describe your hypotheses, data needed, and stakeholders will make you way more efficient. 

\- **Plan update meetings with stakeholders to create soft deadlines for yourself.** This helps you to work towards a date and get work done. 

&amp;#x200B;

### How to communicate insights

\- **Learn good data visualization practices.** Understand how you structure a Powerpoint deck and how you present recommendations. I advise to google for Mckinsey's Powerpoint breakdown. 

\- **Create a dialogue where questions can be asked.** The one you are communicating with will definitely have questions. Allow room in your communication for insights and ask ""was this clear?"" after complicated parts.

\- **Show you are trying to help, not to criticize.** Do not position yourself as the person that knows everything and that the other party is wrong. Be helpful and try to understand where they are coming from.

&amp;#x200B;

### How to collaborate with others

\- **Write code together.** Writing code together helps to stay sharp and spot errors. This will lead to better work.

\- **Use Kanban boards to assign tasks and track progress.** Use Kanban boards to decompose big assignments into smaller tasks. Keep the board updated to track progress.

\- **Have multiple update calls per week.** This depends on the project, but having update calls with your peers \~2 times per week to discuss challenges helps to spend less time on parts where you are stuck.

I can see the replies now: Data science means different things at different companies, different algos are used for different contexts, Python vs R, senior vs junior roles, you're focusing on technologies and implementation while neglecting business context, etc. Yeah, I get it. My goal with this post is, with your help, to build a list of technologies/platform/skills from the broad array of what's considered data science and should be known by a DS with about 3 years of experience, in the opinion of the poster (that's you). Nothing is too broad or specific.

Something, although, is making me very confuse... even if my X variable have a pretty strong positive correlation, its coefficient (when checking the Linear Regression) is negative. Does it makes sense ? Shouldnt the coefficient be positive as well as the correlation metric ?

The negative coefficient tells me that if I increase the X metric, my KPI will deacrese, which goes the opposite way of what my correlation says...

"Let's say I have a sequence of terms. Each term could be any string of alphabetical characters. `['abc', 'stg', 'drT']`. Now let's say I have millions of such sequences of varying length (might be 1 term, might be 1000) and some of them are 'bad'. But their combination matters toward that badness. So I'm baselining and looking for outliers, which should have a high correlation with 'bad' in my dataset. Term might indicate 'badness' in one combination but is totally benign in another.

So that's our search-space and problem statement. I am not educated in DS. But I understand the basic idea: Correlate traits and relationships of features in one or more data-sets to answer a question / solve a problem. But which features to select? It seems like an interesting question, since as analysts we don't know everything and if we try to select feature manually, there's a good chance we might miss something. Right? There might be some combination of features which, when correlated with some combination of other features ends up being a good indicator that we wouldn't have manually expected. Maybe 3 features plotted on a 3D chart with K-Means clustering or just human viewing reveals something interesting / creates a valuable signal that we might not have guessed or tested if we were hand-picking the features we thought might be useful.

So I'm computing an exhaustive list of features globally and locally, like:

How standard / deviant is the feature locally?

* local occurence count
* local occurence as % of total local feature count

How standard / deviant is the feature globally?

* global occurence count
* global occurence count as % of global feature count

How is the feature related to other features locally?

* for each term: for each other term: min distance, where distance is in terms of index
* for each term: for each other term: max distance, where distance is in terms of index
* for each term: for each other term: avg distance, where distance is in terms of index
* for each term: for each other term: min distance, where distance is in terms of character count
* for each term: for each other term: max distance, where distance is in terms of character count
* for each term: for each other term: avg distance, where distance is in terms of character count

How globally standard / deviant is the feature's relationships to other features locally?

* for each term: for each other term: min distance as % of all global min distances between these two symbols, where distance is in terms of index
* for each term: for each other term: max distance as % of all global max distances between these two symbols, where distance is in terms of index
* for each term: for each other term: avg distance as % of all global avg distances between these two symbols, where distance is in terms of index

"[Ergest Xheblati](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ergestxheblati/) is the author of [*Minimum Viable SQL Patterns*](https://ergestx.gumroad.com/l/sqlpatterns), and he's spent the last 15 years mastering SQL.  

In this [SQL workshop](https://youtu.be/UFiZx5NlzL4), Ergest teaches various SQL principles (patters) to help you take your SQL skills from intermediate to expert. More specifically, you'll learn about:   
🎯 Query composition patterns - How to make your complex queries shorter, more legible, and more performant   
🎯 Query maintainability patterns - Constructing CTEs that can be reused. In software engineering, it's called the DRY principle (don't repeat yourself)  
🎯 Query robustness patterns - Constructing queries that don't break when the underlying data changes in unpredictable ways  
🎯 Query performance patterns - Make your queries faster (and cheaper) regardless of specific database you’re using.

Toward the end of the workshop, Ergest answers over a dozen questions from SQL professionals all over the world.

So they have calculus and analytic geometry, intro to statistic analysis and intro to discrete mathematics, matrix and linear algebra (I've heard that this one is very useful for the career), abstract algebraic structures, multivariable calculus, applied differential equations, probability I, and mathematical molding and simulation.

The reason why I listed all of them is because I want to hear your advice to know for sure if taking all of these is worth it or if some of it might be a waste. If any of you are familiar with these courses please let me know. I don't know much yet what path I should take, so any advice would be appreciated.

\- Pull data either in **frequent batches or continuously (streaming) from more than 1000 sources,** all of which will have their own acquisition algorithm (mining, communicating with APIs, Local-fed .csv files etc.) and cleaning

\- Deposit into a **data storage in the cloud** (no server rooms) following manipulation as relational (or whatever you think would be fastest) database system

\- Utilize something like Airflow where I can **run / test the run performance and handle errors** as the **data mining algorithms run in parallel**

\- Use an app full of the **desired dashboards** built using the data we stored previously so the analyses can be displayed using **desired KPIs**

\- Do all this in a cybersecurity-conscious manner

In both situations I was dragged to it even though during the interview process things were promised differently.

All this time I was lazy and weak to improve my skills in DS and I have to admit that my statistics knowledge are okish to mediocre mainly. I know that it’s also a reality for a couple of others and there’s is many companies that are completely ok with this setup.

Right now I have two opportunities in a company that I know some people, one DS and one DE (mid-level) position. Both I have a clear understanding of what will be my attributions and tasks.

I really want to stay in the analytics part of projects but I’m questioning if my DS skills will be sufficient for the DS position, even if I set the expectations beforehand with the manager explaining my previous experience and making things really transparent.

From your experiences is it doable to “make it happen”? I’m really conscious that I’ll have to sharp my skills for both of them, so I’ll also enroll in trainings or and take some homework to do.

Does anyone know about image sequencing? I have this project that I have to do.

Okay, I will explain the dataset and what I have to do. Please do lmk if you guys have any references I can check.

So the dataset consists of images with their sequence id. For example:- let us say there are 3 images.

1. The first one is where a person walks to his table. Which will be the first order of the sequence.
2. The second order is the person getting a glass of water.
3. The third is him drinking the water from the glass.

Like this, there will be lots of images. 6 in one sequence so each sequence will have 1-6.

So what I have to do is train a model with the first 3 images of the sequence and then the model will have to predict the other three images and the output will be the order of the image. Example - \[1,2,3\]

It took a while to run the backend, understand their microservice framework, and this is my first time creating one.

I understand being a good backend engineer can't hurt, and if I wanted to, it provides skills if I ever want to pivot to SWE. But I feel like there's a LOT more to learn within the data science field already but now I have to add SWE to that list as well?  

On the one hand, I understand that DS isn't just building models, cleaning data. It's using data to help the business, regardless of the tools you use. So if microservices and proper deployment gain visibility and actually 'productionize' your model, then it's just something you do.

"I'm trying to generate a gibberish language to use for character dialogue in a game, similar to the 'Animalese' of Animal Crossing. 


At the moment, I am hashing the English input sentences, truncating the hash to match the input sentence length, and then mapping each hex character of the hash to an arbitrary syllable (which is associated with an audio clip). While this works well enough, I am hoping to add some realism using universal sentence embeddings, so that similar sentence meanings map to similar gibberish forms and it hopefully seems more like a real language. I need the following features:

1. Sentences with similar meanings should have a similar gibberish output. For example, if the sentence 'hi there' maps to 'grebgol', the sentence 'hello!' should be likely to translate to 'grebgol' as well, or a string similar to it. 

2. A gibberish sentence should have approximately the same number of syllables as the input English sentence. e.g. ""Look!"" might generate ""Shleg!"" but ""This path is dangerous"" might generate ""Vnepsweg zeb sirugkijun"". 


So far, my code is generating a sentence embedding for each input sentence using Tensorflow Universal Sentence Encoder. But I am not sure how to go about generating a gibberish string from the embedding. I suppose I need some kind of dimensionality reduction like PCA analysis to obtain a set of one dimensional vectors from my list of input sentences.

But there is no literature on effect size calculation if my data is skewed, I am thinking of Cohen's D and since it also assumes normality, perform log normal transformation on my data and perform t test and Cohen's D on that. 

From my reading transformed t-test p value is applicable for raw data as well but not sure about Cohen's D.

I would like to know how to reward DAOs not on a task basis, but by calculating their contribution through data analysis.  
If we can create that method with high quality, I believe we can create a new system of economy that will be upward compatible with capitalism.  
We call it freeism.  


About freeism

We came up with the ""freeism"" system as an alternative economic mechanism to capitalism.

It gives a new alternative to economic mechanisms that have had only limited choices, such as capitalism and socialism.

I know that many people are already thinking about this kind of thing, but I would like to implement it as a part of the social structure, not as a theoretical theory, and eventually create a society in which the entire economy revolves around freeism instead of capitalism.

&amp;#x200B;

Basic Mechanism of Freeism

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The following is an explanation of the basic mechanism of FREELISM.

&amp;#x200B;

The supplier is asked to provide all types of goods and services for free, and non-transferable points (SBT?) (called contribution points) are given to those who provide them.

There will be multiple ways to calculate contribution points, and we will also create a mechanism to provide them.

The mechanism is described below.

For products or services that are not available to all who want them (hereinafter referred to as ""limited edition products""), the points (hereinafter referred to as ""quota"") will be set as the square root of contribution points, and those who offer to use the most quota will be given priority in using them.

Instead of consuming contribution points as compensation for obtaining goods or services, they should only be accounted for so that they cannot be used to obtain other limited items.

Therefore, contribution points do not decrease even if a limited item is obtained but accumulate (exceptions apply. See below)

Necessity

The necessity of the quota is described below.

The method of calculating the quota is also described below.

This type of economic mechanism is called ""freeism.

Freeism is an economic model that can be finally established by using technologies such as data analysis, blockchain, web apps, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Dig a little deeper into the mechanism of FREESISM

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This section explains each of the mechanisms that make up FREESISM.

&amp;#x200B;

Contribution rules

The rules of contribution are the laws that govern life in a freeism society.

Or the country in which the law is located.

At first, only one rule exists, but just as there are multiple countries, multiple rules of contribution can be created.

The contribution rules should be easy for anyone to create.

I want the rules of contribution to be divided by ideology and taste (only some people emigrate based on taxation, culture, and taste, but for the most part, the current country is determined by birth and upbringing, and there are people with different tastes, values, and ideology in the same country, which creates conflict).

That is why we create the right of non-interference as the right not to interfere with others.

Each contribution rule has an end goal.

The end goal is discussed below.

&amp;#x200B;

The FREEISM Platform

The freeism platform is a mechanism to manage the rules of contribution.

The rules of contribution play a legal role.

The freeism platform becomes a higher-level entity like the Constitution OR the UN OR the federal government.

The freeism platform also has rules, and within the scope of those rules, they get to make the rules of contribution.

There will be multiple freeism platforms, and people will be able to join any freeism platform they want.

A freeism platform may also have an end goal.

The end goal is described below.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Final Goal

The end goal is the goal that each freeism platform, each contribution rule, and each project (like a company) is aiming for.

It can be set by vote, decided at the establishment stage, or left to the decision-makers to set.

Set goals that you want to achieve, not goals or KPIs to achieve subdivided goals.

For example, ""increase in happiness,"" ""degree of health,"" ""increase in productivity,"" ""increase in the number of rational decisions made,"" and ""crime rate.""

It is unclear if we would set ""lower crime rate"" as a goal since even ""lower crime rate"" might be a goal to achieve higher levels of happiness. We want to set a goal that we are ultimately aiming for.

For FREEISM, we should set a final goal for the FREEISM platform, a final goal for the contribution rule, and a final goal for the project, and then calculate the contributions based on how much they have helped to bring us closer to or achieve that final goal.

Examples of final goals

Increase in productivity (working hours required to obtain goods and services) within the limits of the law

Increase in happiness within the limits of the law

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Contribution points

Refers to points required to obtain priority for limited items.

Contribution points are non-transferable.

However, loans are possible under some contribution rules.

Can I use SBT as contribution points?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How to Calculate Contribution Points

Contribution points earned are calculated based on ""the degree of contribution to the final goal"" ✖︎ ""market principle"" ✖︎ ""different weighting/rules for each contribution rule.""

Until now, it was ""market principles"" ✖︎ ""different weighting/rules for each country or region rule"", but we will add ""degree of contribution to the final goal"" to it.

I think the market principle is encapsulated in the degree of contribution to the final goal. However, if you still want to make further use of the market principle, you can give contribution points based on ""market principle x degree of contribution to the final goal"" or ""market principle only"".

The degree of contribution to the final goal could be calculated using multiple regression analysis or other data analysis methods or methods to visualize DAO's task-based contribution.

See below.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Quota

The quota is a mechanism to avoid monopolizing the service, and if the service can be provided to everyone, the quota is not used.

Each contribution rule has a different way of calculating the quota, and each person is given a quota weighted by contribution points (contribution points ✖️0.9 = amount of quota, etc.) or the square root of contribution points.

The amount of quota used will be the price.

There is a negative correlation: the lower the winning rate of a product or service, the more quota it occupies, and the closer the winning rate is to 100%, the less quota it occupies.

In FREESISM, the quota is always used while the limited item is in use, and the amount used always reflects the market value, not the amount used when it was acquired.

The structure of the quota differs for each contribution rule.

The period you occupy a quota should be the period you own that limited edition item.

If you give it away or throw it away, you can apply for it on the FREEMISM platform, or the service will automatically detect it and release the use of the quota.

To prevent ""false applications"" where people apply to give it away when they own it, make it necessary to give it away or throw it away at a predetermined location or app.

Create an incentive to have it detected through the app, since it should be detected from each app and if not through the app, it will occupy the frame all the time.

Make it impossible for people to report that they have given it up on their own, other than by having the app automatically detect it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

FREEISM

In freeism, if other people refer to the products, services, source code, or other deliverables developed by each person, or to know-how and other things such as research findings, they will receive only a portion of the contribution points earned by the person they refer to, such as 0.5 times the contribution points earned by the person they refer to.

Thereby.

If someone only submits an idea and others implement it, the person who submitted the idea will also receive a portion of the contribution points earned by the person who implemented it.

If another company started a business and failed but was successful in running it by avoiding the strategies of the failed company, then allow the people who worked in the failed company to receive a portion of the contribution points earned by the successful company.

That way, where it was 0-1 to succeed or fail, maybe we could make it so that even if it fails, it is not 0-1 financially, but there is some benefit.

Since points are just points, unlike the currency, they don't have to be distributed and can be offered to both.

But it's hard to determine if that's what I was referring to.

I will discuss this later.

We want a society where everything is open source.

I want to create a society where every no-how, patent, and other thing is open source, by weighting the contribution points that can be earned if others use the no-how, and by weighting the contribution points that can be earned just by making it open source, such as 1.2 times the contribution points that can be earned by making it open source.

Everyone gets it without having to distribute, and being open source could lead to more compensation for sharing without monopolizing rather than monopolizing and competing.

But if the relative position without distribution determines whether you get a limited product, is it the same as when profits were shared?

It's more mentally stable because you don't have to fight for a piece of the pie.

The basic idea is to think in terms of rules of contribution, where the only rule is the degree of contribution to the liberal end goal, but when considering various rules of contribution, we can make a law that regulates each of them in a way that is characteristic to the sound of each rule of contribution.

Even if any action is the wrong action or not, we will stipulate that only actions that have a bad impact on the final goal contribution level are bad.

Even theft would not be a crime if it did not negatively impact anyone.

Somewhere the idea is like a woman who says it's not cheating if she doesn't get caught in a love story about whether or not she qualifies as cheating.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The position of each

In freeism, the system is divided into a freeism platform, contribution rules, projects, and other mechanisms.

The freeism platform is the role of the federal government, the contribution rule is the role of the state government, and the project is the role of the company.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Project

The role of the company.

The idea of freeism is to make everything open, so all the data of companies that are currently hidden will be shared and made available to everyone so that the contribution points earned will be weighted 1.1 times more than before.

Or, by being more open, make the service more technical and reliable, so that it is seen as contributing to the well-being and other end goals.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Price

The lower the winning rate (the percentage of people who apply who win), the more quota is occupied and the more the beneficiary pays.

The amount of quota used becomes the price, so if the winning rate increases, the price becomes ""completely free"" with zero quota use of zero yen.

In capitalism, even for products with high demand and high supply, the price is close to the cost, but the beneficiaries bear the burden.

In FREEMISM, the overall goods and services are cheaper because they are negatively correlated with the winning rate, regardless of cost.

Furthermore, since the added value cannot be added to the price, the price becomes cheaper by that amount, and the beneficiary burden of freeism is better than the beneficiary burden of capitalism.

The provider of goods and services receives nothing from the beneficiary for providing goods and services, and the beneficiary pays nothing to the provider for acquiring goods and services, which only increases the amount that occupies the quota managed by the freeism platform.

The provider can offer goods and services to those who cannot afford to pay for them, and if they do, the business will be compensated.

  
Life of FREEISM

Let's imagine and write about what society would be like in a society where FREESISM is realized.

&amp;#x200B;

Download or use any of the web apps, native apps, VR or AR apps of the freeism app (which also serves as the freeism platform) that manages all the functions of freeism, from a web app, native app, VR, or AR app, or a browser.

In the freeism app, choose the contribution rule to which you want to belong.

Enter various information about yourself and link it to the contribution rule you have chosen, and generate an account with the data for that contribution rule.

You can put the date of the contribution rule you belong to as a property in your wallet for Web3, or in your Google account for Web2, etc.

With the account containing that data, data is acquired from various applications and the contribution rules are calculated using that data.

Furthermore, according to each contribution rule, you can display 00 content on Twitter, but not 00. If the content is prohibited by each rule of each contribution level, such as ""00 content is allowed to be displayed on Twitter, but 00 is prohibited,"" each rule of each contribution level will be detected from the account and automatically hidden.

When you want to get a product or service on each platform of freeism services or existing services (Amazon, Spotify, etc.), you can get the person's contribution points from the API that can get the contribution points of each person managed by that freeism platform, and Then, we can set up an input field in the platform, such as Amazon, where people can input how many quotas they want to offer, and those who offer the highest amount will be given priority to receive?

Is it faster to create a new one?

Those who offer limited items in the above process will receive contribution points for the contribution rules to which they belong.

There is no such thing as an exchange rate between multiple contribution points, so the more contribution rules that contribute to the ultimate goal of the freeism platform, the larger the percentage to be offered (tentative idea).

Compatibility between freeism platforms is discussed below.",datascience,14702,2454

"I understand that you need to do Power analysis in order to figure out what sample size you need for your AB test, but something that I have difficulty coming up with is “what MDE should we use?”  Researching online hasn’t been much help because all I see are examples of where they just give an MDE to use but don’t explain the process of getting there. 

For my company, a lot of our tests have very low operational costs, so in almost all cases any positive performance is worth rolling out. Basically, even if we saw only a 0.05% lift, if it was statistically significant, we’d probably implement the change. This has led me down a path where I basically just check to see what MDE we can reasonably detect given the number of users coming into the platform INSTEAD of determining what MDE is actually valuable. I feel like this is the wrong approach, but I’m unsure what else to do given that our “goal” MDE is basically anything above 0. This especially makes it difficult for me to determine when I should stop the tests as well, other than picking a somewhat arbitrary end point of 3-4 weeks and then seeing if there is any directional value from the data. 

What would you do in this situation? How do you determine the MDE for your AB tests?

"Hi,  I am wondering about about some recent trends I have been experienced at work with younger or less experienced data scientists.

People are fitting these large multivariate, nonlinear models that come directly from python libraries, for example PyOD outlier detection.   They just compare results from all the built in ML algos.   They don't think about any simple methods what so ever for detecting outliers.   However, the end user always drills down to univariate to see if the features are significant anyway.     So I don't see the purpose in testing the advanced algos without a baseline.

So instead of starting with a basic statistical outlier method, or univariate or linear method,like PCA, all of this is skipped and considered irrelevant or ""dinosaur"".  

My argument is that if you don't have a baseline simple method, you will never understand the benefit the ML algo brings .    Basically if they cant can't find a benefit over univariate ,  they shouldn't promote the advanced methods yet.

What are your thoughts on this?

How do I convince these people to slow down and take baby steps to see the benefits without insulting them?

"Hey guys, I don't have much of a background in data science, but I'm interested in doing some analyses for fun on a data set I have.

Long story short:

- I have a set of 3d matrices that represent physical systems (basically point clouds). 

- I have a certain routine that generates vectors that can describe certain physical properties of the systems represented by the 3d matrices. This routine always generates the same sized property vector, independent of system matrix size. There are multiple 3d system matrices that can yield the same property vector.

- I want to determine which elements of the 3d system matrices have the greatest effect on each of the elements of the property vectors.

I've seen principle component analysis used in fields other than my own to conduct similar sorts of analyses, and my intuition is to start there. However, I'm not confident that this would work and would appreciate any feedback or advice!

"Hi,

I am sorry to spam another post about career advice. I will divide this post into two sections so it will be easier to read/advise. You can skip background if you are not interested and jump straight to my question.

BACKGROUND: I am currently a data analyst (for about 3 years). I've got into the field by accident (internship at uni) and just stayed, landed my first job in healthcare and about 5 months ago I moved to a cyber security company.

I've learned everything on my own so far. I use Excel, SQL, Power Bi, domo, Salesforce, Workday, Oracle and more in my work. I am relatively good (my managers are happy with my work). At the end of the year I will receive a set of objectives, so I could get a promotion as senior data analyst.

With that being said, Even though I have some experience in workplace, I dont have any educational background (I have a master's in management  which helps in some ways but it is not enough). Since I joined this sub I have read many post/comments and sometimes when I read them, I think you are casting some spells. English is not my first language (I speak it fluently as I live now in the UK) and some vocabulary or definitions are too foreign to me. I believe I could fix it with some education.

&amp;#x200B;

QUESTION: I am data analyst, hopefully at some point senior data analyst, but I am planning to try working as a business analyst and eventually as a data scientist (Im not in rush but that is my goal). I would like to start learning from the basics. I have around 6-8 months of relative peace and extra time. I want to complete statistic/probability course, which hopefully will help me advance in my career.

First I want to learn calculus, statistics and probability. It should help me to become a business analyst. Later in the future, move to python, machine learning etc. and move towards data science. I want to focus first on the former. 

Could I ask you redditors to help me find a course (preferably with some certificate at the end) for an introduction to statistics? I have checked edX. MiT's courses look the best, but enrolment is too far in the future to wait for it. Apart from MIT I found 'Probability and Statistics' (4 courses) from Georgia Tech. I also check coursera and 'Business Statistics and Analysis Specialization' from Rice looks ok-ish. These take different lengths of time to complete, but I am pretty flexible. As said before, I have about 6-8 months and I could spend up to around 10h per week. If you know the course which will take me 3 months but is great, I will gladly take it. There are also some shorter courses on DataCamp but I would prefer something a bit more serious and in depth.

I hope that makes sense. What are your thoughts and advice?

Thank you so much for helping in advance.

I feel like they know the grants are generous, and are charging extravagant prices because the genrous grants will help cover those salaries anyway.

Obviously, I'm a bit jealous, because I feel like I don't get a fair share of the pie in this deal. My company wants to develop a certain level of expertise in data science, but are throwing all the grant money at consultants and leaving a lot less for actual employees.

"Step 1) Watch a project tutorial on YouTube/Datacamp/Udemy and code along. Focus on learning the concept rather than the syntax. 

Step 2) Open a blank page, and code everything from scratch. Google syntax, only look back at the video if absolutely lost. Check if I got the same result as the tutorial. 

Step 3) Manipulate the project by changing factors. 

Step 4) Repeat the entire project with a brand new data set.

"So I am doing a MSc in Electrical Engineering and I'm trying to take as many ""data science"" classes as possible. Stuff like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Optimization, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Databases, Cloud Computing, etc...

You will notice that I didn't list any stats classes and I know I should probably learn about it more if I want to get a job in Data Science or as a Machine Learning Engineer.

I am planning on taking some online courses about GLMs, Time Series, Bayesian Statistics, etc... so if you have any recommendations feel free to list them out but I also wanted to ask: how should I add them to my CV? Should I make a new subsection under education and list all the extra courses I took?

I know I could learn about these topics by reading books but that has 2 disadvantages:

1. I usually prefer having people explaining topics to me over just reading

" In theory, could hospital triage be solved using ""regression models"" (e.g. logistic regression, random forest regression)? Suppose you have a historical dataset where you data (covariates) on patients such as ""age, gender, height, weight, blood pressure, etc."" , and the response variable is ""the number of days the patient spent in the hospital"".

1) Just a shot in the dark - it seems that you should be able to make a regression model that predicts ""how long the patient is expected to stay in the hospital""?

2) Suppose the hospital is interested in improving how they triage their patients. In this imaginary example, let's say that the hospital wants to identify patients who will be discharged from the hospital shortly after they come to the hospital (because the logic being, patients who leave the hospital shortly after coming to the hospital, usually have non threatening conditions and do not need to be prioritized). Suppose the hospital makes such a regression model : now for 5 new patients, they predict the discharge times for these patients as (2 days, 5 days, 30 days, 40 days, 10 days).

If the hospital has reasons to believe that the regression model is effective (based on performance)- (along with the prediction intervals for these estimates) would it be reasonable for the hospital not to prioritize the patients who are expected to stay only 2 days and 5 days in the hospital?

3) does anyone have any recommendations for statistical/machine learning models that can be used to help humans with these kinds of triage decisions?

"Hello I need some advice how to best start my project.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been given a dataset where each row equals a produced workpiece in a factory.

&amp;#x200B;

Each row (workpiece) has columns with information about:

\- the parts (batch numbers) it consists of (categorical data)

\- measured values along the production process  (continuous data) 

\- a specific label for if the workpiece got a failure in the production process or is good (boolean)

&amp;#x200B;

An important info:  

&amp;#x200B;

From left to right in a row, the measured values are grouped into production steps. 

&amp;#x200B;

So first I have measured data for step 1 (then gets evaluated if it has a failure)

Then I have measured data for step 2 (then gets evaluated if it has a failure)

Then I have measured data for step 3 .. and so on ..

&amp;#x200B;

This also means that if a workpiece gets a failure along production step 2, there is no further data for step 3 available because it got removed at step 2.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to find out:

\- potential workpieces that might a failure at the current step.

\- potential workpieces that might have a failure at a later step (for example step 4) based on data from previous steps (for example step 1 and 2).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It kind of sounds like a logistic regression problem to me. I can do supervised learning because I have the label wether a workpiece has a failure or is ok.

Also I can split the datasets column wise into parts (depicting the production steps). This will probably result in many ml models for every possible combination of steps and previous steps..

I am doing a credit risk migration exercise between two time periods. I have the data of relevant credit risk parameters and rating for companies in the two periods and I am measuring the impact of credit rating migration between the two periods on for example PD, i.e. How much is the difference of the avg. PD for the different ratings of period 2 with the projected PD from period 1 using Credit migration matrix calculated using the migration in ratings?

I am not sure if I should exclude companies with PD=0 when calculating the actual avg. PD for different credit ratings for the two periods. Intuitively, companies with PD=0 have no outstanding loan and do not add risk or capital requirements. These clients can be used to calculate the credit migration matrix and should be kept for its calculation. However, they bias the Avg. PD for the different rating periods (lead to an underestimation). if you have experience in credit risk,

**MAIN QUESTION:**

DO YOU KNOW IF I SHOULD REMOVE CUSTOMERS WITH PD=0 FROM THE TWO PERIODS WHEN I CALCULATE THE ACTUAL AVG. PD FOR EACH RATING OF THE SECOND PERIOD AND WHEN I PROJECT THE AVG. PD OF THE FIRST PERIOD USING THE CREDIT MIGRATION MATRIX?

"What are the common indexes to use when measuring and reporting model performance in production?

In our case it's a binary classification model (e.g. credit risk). Here are the stages the model goes through:

* Development - here we use GINI / AUC.
* Deployment - the model is exposed through an API
* Production - the model is used to score production records and a decision is taken based on the result whether to approve/deny (this decision is based on some business logic but eventually uses a cutoff point for the model)
* Feedback - after some events has happened in real life, the results are fed back to the system and attached as ""feedback"" to the predicted records. This is true world label result.

At first I thought to measure AUC/GINI of the production data, however I quickly realized that I have only half the picture. AUC is measured from the ROC and in the case of production we only have ""Negatives"" that is - records which have been predicted to be non-eventful. So the best we would have is ""non events we predicted and their results"". To get the ROC we also need events.

What would you measure in such case?

"Suppose you have ""postal codes"" and you want to use them as a variable in your data.

If two postal codes only share the first character, then they are probably pretty dissimilar. And if they share the first 3 characters, then they are expected to be somewhat similar to each other.

My question: suppose you want to use postal codes as a variable in a statistical model, but you are not sure whether to include all 6 characters, or the 5 characters, or the first 4 characters, etc. Each one of these might include some potentially useful information.

If you decide to use a random forest model (which is known to be robust to redundant variables), would it make sense to turn the postal code into 6 separate variables? E.g.

var_1 = 1st character 
var_2 = 1st and 2nd character

"Hi all,

I just wanted to make this post to simply share my experience (and also get your perspective/input) using different coding languages, namely python and R, to perform data analysis. I am by no means any expert; just a simple user who is completely in awe with this field.

I have only recently started to code in R (2 months now) and ever since, I cannot help but love it. I only started learn to code since last year and like many, I started off with python because the ML project I was working on last year required me to learn this language.

Since then, I moved to a different lab and the folks there really wanted me to use R to develop the code for data cleaning, performing exploratory data analysis, regression analyses, etc..., since it is the most commonly used language in this field (Enviro. Chem).

While I was initially resistant at first to learn R, once I got the hang of it, it really started to feel like magic to me. What took me maybe 3 to 5 lines of code in python to perform a task (granted, I am not the best coder) is a simple function in R. Somehow, it all just intuitively makes sense to me.

I don't know; I don't find R getting much love out there (at least in my learning experience of data science), and just wanted to make a post about it. I aim to get much better in this language (and also python too), simply because I find this to be a very powerful language.

I guess that concludes my love letter to R.

"I've assigned a task to analyze *customer understanding*. Here's what available in sale data

ID, Age, Invoice, Value, Country, Cluster (already segmented), lifetime value (from model), promo tier (from model), purchased product, and revenue.

The steps I have in my mind are to do:

1. Basic analytics break down into country, age group (or generation), and cluster (like number of invoices, number of client, and revenue)
2. RFM analysis to identify characteristic of top clients. Then again, break down the analytics of those top clients into country, age, and each cluster.
3. Product view, identify which products are often purchased for client base and for top clients. (This can be done by checking word frequency in product description). Then again, break down product view into into country, age, and each cluster.
4. Plot a time series of revenue, number active clients by month to see they respond (multiple line chart series for age, country, and, cluster, so 3 subplots).
5. Predicting their sales next month, and their next purchase days. (This is optional imo)
6. Also, an important step is how to transfer those insights into more making money action?

" Hi everyone!

I wanted to introduce the first North American Students Biotechnology Conference (NASBC)! The conference will be held virtually in July, and will be free to attend and present in.

NASBC aims to provide a forum for undergraduate and graduate students across North America to share biotechnology research. It is a great opportunity to expand your network and showcase your research project to others in your field. If you're not in the field and would just like to learn about it, feel free to RSVP as well! While the presentations will be limited to those in North America, attendance is open to all!

Research will be divided into 8 categories (found on the [website](https://nasbcportal.com/)). One thing I'd like to mention is that there is a category - namely 'Innovation in Biotech', that is specifically for those projects you feel don't really fit into the other categories but combine technology with the health field. I'm pointing this out for those computer science or software engineering students, who have worked on a cool app that would support the health sector.

The abstract submission deadline is coming up soon to remember to send in your abstract ASAP!

Additional information is found on the website ([nasbcportal.com](https://nasbcportal.com/)). The related instagram is [@nasbioc](https://www.instagram.com/nasbioc/).

I hope to see you there",datascience,1380,214

"I have the order dates of a 100 different products going back more than a decade and want to do forecasting to the best of my ability. The data is clean and consistent, though some items aren't ordered very often.

The two approaches I've thought of is 

1. To do a monthly aggregate of how much product was ordered across all items and do a basic SARIMA with 1s for all values and a time lag of 12 months.
2. To use the prophet library to predict the future, though these results have been poor due to the items having a greater volatility and growth as of late due to covid, product output, and other outside factors.

Avenues I'm considering:

1. Hyperparameter tuning for SARIMA.
2. Using the monthly aggregate of all items to help forecast each individual item, as building SARIMA models for each individual item may not be as useful due to a lack of data, as some items may not be ordered at all some months.
3. Read more of the prophet documentation to try to adjust for the extreme volatility in my data.
4. Try messing around with ML time series forecasting libraries and see what can be done.

"Non-data scientist struggling to find the “right” way to set up populations for control vs variant testing, and am wondering if my methodology holds any ground.

Then once I have every customer assigned a unique rank I choose only the odd numbered ranks and keep the even ranked customers as the control that is excluded from the campaign.

My thought is that this would provide an even distribution of our best customers in the control and variant groups.

I've read that it depends on other parameters, like proportion/balance of 0 and 1 on the dataset. In my case, it's about 10% of 1.

"I'm a CS student and i've recently been interviewing for several Data Science Internships, one of the companies was a walking red flag. Keep in mind that this wasn't a small startup, this was a huge Company (&gt; 10k employees).

It started when I applied for the position online, they responded after over a month, once I already had several offers. What was interesting was that they were the only company that called me as their first response and did not send a mail, which was a surprise but not a deal breaker to me. They wanted to make a short Teams interview, which I accepted since I wanted to have the Interview Training, but would only consider them if they would be a really great fit.

So far so good, we arrange an interview for the following Monday at 1 pm in the call.

About 3 Hours after the call, they send me a Teams link via Mail, which was written pretty unprofessionally, and looked like they they hadn't put much thought in it. What I immediately notice was that the Teams Link they send me was for 11:30 am on Monday, not 1 pm like we had agreed upon, which was really strange. So I send them a mail asking when the Interview **really** is, and that I would be fine with both timeframes, but would like to know when. I get a response back about 2 hours later, saying that the other employee that would be present can't get to it at 1 pm, so they decided to move the Interview. I immediately see the red flag, they had just moved the Interview, without talking to me first, and didnt even think of telling me. I shrug it off and told them it was fine, since I was not planning on taking the job anyways.

Fast forward to Monday 11:30 am:

I join the Teams Meeting, they start out with a little small talk/chit-chat. And we proceed to the Interview. They talk a little about what they do (at max 2 minutes) and then ask me to introduce myself, which I do and then we just do a standard interview which goes great for the most part. What they really emphasized at multiple points, was that they wanted to have an Intern for ""A long time"" so they were really straight forward, asking me for how many years I will study CS (probably so they can know for how long they can get away with paying me less), and proceed to talk about how they ""Keep their Interns for a long time"".

Then one of them starts to list all the people in their branch, which was weird, since he didn't list a single Data Scientist (The role that the internship was for), which made me suspicious. Then, in the middle of the Interview I get to ask some Questions, so I ask what they will expect from the intern and what kind of task he be responsible for. When they answered I immediately thought ""Wow, that sounds alot like a Python Developer Role, not Data Science"", which made sense since they kept asking for my python skills, which as itself is not a problem since I am very comfortable with my Python knowledge, but it made me really sceptical, so I keep asking more specific Questions until im am certain of it. Since I was 100% sure that this wasn't a DS Role and I was not worried of not getting the Job, I ask ""Why did you call the Job listing Data Science when it sounds alot like a Python Developer Role?"". The answer was not what I thought, one of the Interviewers straight up told me to my face that they ""knew it was not a DS role, but decided to call it that anyway since its such a great buzzword, and they would get a lot more applicants that way"" (this is as close to a 100% quote as I can recall, so this is not exaggerated) , which really made me speechless. After that I just decided to play nice until the Interview was over, but had already decided that I was not going to take their offer, if they would make me one.

Fast Forward 2 Weeks:

After they had told me that they would get back to me by the end of the Week, they didn't, and after two weeks I receive an Email that they had decided for another applicant (that poor dude). My guess is that they smelled that I didn't want to take the job anyways and if I did, I would not stay for long since it became pretty clear that I knew they were full of shit.

"Hi all,

I recently came across the original [Tidy Data paper](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10) (if you haven't read this, check it out- I wish I had a long time ago) and have been thinking a lot about how to best reorganize data from my experiments to make analyses and visualization easier. However, my datasets seem kind of unconventional and I haven't found great examples for how to best tidy them.

Basically, I continuously collect rodent behavioral data in sessions that span 60 trials. I collect **timestamps** of events of interest (e.g. lever press, trial start). So my data looks something like this currently (I've been playing with both Matlab structs and Python pandas.dataframes). For simplicity I shortened this example to just 3 trials. 

&amp;#x200B;

|subject|group|date|trialType|trialStart|behaviorA|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|0|20210601|\[0,0,1\]|\[10,40,60\]|\[8,12,42,65\]|
|2|1|20210601|\[0,0,1\]|\[10,40,60\]|\[15,22,26,48,53\]|
|3|0|20210601|\[0,0,1\]|\[10,40,60\]|\[12,42,80\]|
|1|0|20210602|\[0,0,1\]|\[10,40,60\]|\[4,22,45,63\]|
|2|1|20210602|\[0,0,1\]|\[10,40,60\]|\[30,44,68\]|
|3|0|20210602|\[0,0,1\]|\[10,40,60\]|\[12,29,43,63,68\]|

&amp;#x200B;

Notice that the events contain arrays of multiple values, which makes it ""untidy"". Currently I have one row per subject per date (this corresponds to my raw data files). While this organization is intuitive to me, it seems to make it harder to conveniently plot and analyze the data using readily available packages.

In order to have a single value, I was thinking of reorganizing it so that each row corresponds to a time bin in every file. Instead of event timestamps, the events would be binary coded so that a 1 would be placed at the corresponding timestamp and would be 0 otherwise. It would look like:

&amp;#x200B;

|subject|group|date|timeBin|trialStart|trialType|behaviorA|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|0|20210601|1|0|0|0|
|1|0|20210601|2|0|0|0|
|1|0|20210601|3|1|2|0|
|1|0|20210601|4|0|0|0|
|1|0|20210601|5|0|0|1|
|1|0|20210601|6|0|0|0|

My event timestamps are sampled at 10ms resolution and I have a few hundred files so this could get huge but I guess I could downsample by rounding the timestamps. 

This dataset is pretty much the ""template"" of most of my datasets but I also have more complex datasets where I am continuously tracking a variable over time (e.g. I have video recordings I can use to track position &amp; velocity) so I think organizing things by timestamp may effectively translate to those in the long run?

An alternative would be to have one row for each trial, but this wouldn't be effective if I am also collecting a continuous variable. 

I'd love any feedback &amp; ideas about how to best organize these data! That includes coding resources and packages if you have recommendations.",datascience,2816,381
"Hey, I haven't been getting long, solid responses from this sub in overall, but I'm gonna try again. Hope someone can shed some pointers anyway!

So we don't have a system in place for data, and I'm tasked with setting it all up. There's a few mariadb servers that have to be piped to a centralised data store for BI. There's also data from Facebook Marketing API that I'd ideally like a pre-built connector for.

Several criteria are: No vendor lock-in if possible, low volumes of data, but needed in real-time and incrementally sync'ed. Not using cloud db's since our volumes don't justify the need for it, plus prefer to keep things local.

What's the best way to go about doing this? Some of the options I've considered:

\- use a pipeline like Stitch (but that's rather expensive for this use case) and so I've considered Airbyte but this open source software is still very immature, despite some help from the nice people over there.

\- Tried using Clickhouse replication but it doesn't work for mariadb

\- considering something hybrid with Airflow (or the newer [Prefect.io](https://Prefect.io)) to schedule and pipe data. This probably also means using some manually-coded connectors?

Data warehouse DB is not selected yet either. I'm thinking, for this use case, something simple like Clickhouse or Postgres (though this one isn't exactly an OLAP).

Preferably, I'd use pre-built solutions, since code is not my forte, but I am open to considering simple, easily debuggable code solutions.

This ends up being sometimes hundreds of lines of data, with a lot of stuff (strings, numbers, tables in tables, etc). Since the data is live during development, I end up wanting to change it a lot, add and remove things, etc. It obviously gets unwieldy doing it right in the editor, editing hundreds of lines. Previously I’ve made Google Sheets to handle it. I love spreadsheets but even I will admit this is cumbersome:

    =""M.map_info[hash(""""""&amp;B3&amp;"""""")] = {script_require = """"maps.map_codes.""&amp;B3&amp;"""""", display_name=[[""&amp;E3&amp;""]], biome = """"""&amp;C3&amp;"""""", max_level=""&amp;P3&amp;"", min_level=""&amp;Q3&amp;"", store_level_cap=""&amp;R3&amp;"", player_tint_add = vmath.vector4(""&amp;S3&amp;"",""&amp;T3&amp;"",""&amp;U3&amp;"",""&amp;V3&amp;""), player_tint_subtract = vmath.vector4(""&amp;W3&amp;"",""&amp;X3&amp;"",""&amp;Y3&amp;"",""&amp;Z3&amp;""), cloud =""&amp;M3&amp;"", border = ""&amp;N3&amp;"", map_zoom = ""&amp;O3&amp;"", music = {id=""""""&amp;H3&amp;"""""", force=""&amp;I3&amp;"", ambient=""""""&amp;K3&amp;"""""", ambient_multiplier=""&amp;L3&amp;"", rest_time=""&amp;J3&amp;""}}""    

Generally speaking, tables might look something like this:    
{a_number = 2, a_string = ""string here"", subtable = {3}},    
{a_number = 4, a_string = ""another_string"", subtable = {}},    
{a_number = 8, a_string = ""yet_another_string"", subtable = {3,5,7,11,13,17,19}},    

The main stumbling block ends up being the subtables, which can have none, one, or multiple values. I haven't figured out a good way to handle this in a spreadsheet. I can either begin entering comma-delineated values manually (this is bad because it’s manual, makes it hard to keep track of the data, and eventually begins resembling the reason I implemented the spreadsheet in the first place), or I have x number of columns for each individual data point in the subtable (this is bad because it is cumbersome to set up and implies a maximum number of entries in a subtable).    

Does this make sense? Is there a better way to handle this? Some kind of tool (free is great, but I'll pay to make my life easier)?

So many posts on this topic and all seem to have an underlying premise that data cleaning sucks and that the modeling is what's interesting/fun. But the cleaning takes up so much time precisely because it's very challenging, ambiguous. It's the part of the process I think will be last to be automated (if it ever is). I get that modeling can provide deep insights and/or value and so are certainly rewarding, but I *really* think many of our conversations on this topic miss the point.

"I am trying to build a similar image retrieval system where given an image, the system is able to show top 'k' most similar images to it. For this particular example, I am using the [DeepFashion](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html) dataset where given an image containing say a shirt, you show top 5 clothes most similar to a shirt. A subset of this has 289,222 diverse clothes images in it. Each image is of shape: (300, 300, 3).

The approach I have includes:

1. Train an autoencoder
2. Feed each image in the dataset through the encoder to get a reduced n-dimensional latent space representation. For example, it can be 100-d latent space representation
3. Create a table of shape m x (n + 2) where 'm' is the number of images and each image is compressed to n-dimensions. One of the column is the image name and the other column is a path to where the image is stored on your local system
4. Given a new image, you feed it through the encoder to get the n-dimensional latent space representation
5. Use something like cosine similarity, etc to compare the n-d latent space for new image with the table m x (n + 2) obtained in step 3 to find/retrieve top k closest clothes

How do I create the table mentioned in step 3? 

I am planning on using TensorFlow 2.5 with Python 3.8 and the code for getting an image generator is as follows:

    image_generator = ImageDataGenerator(
        rescale = 1./255, rotation_range = 135)

"Are statistical models in theory able to make predictions about individuals? Suppose you have an individual with observed covariate information (x = a, y = b, z = c) : in theory, can a regression model (trained well on some data) predict the expected value of this individual's response variable?

I heard today that statistical models are not designed to make predictions about individuals. They are only designed to predict the average behavior of a large group of individuals - and in theory, should not be used to make predictions about individuals.

Is this correct? Does this mean that any time statistical models are used to make individual predictions, this is going against the intended use of statistical models?

If I understand correctly: this means that when a statistical model makes a prediction about an individual with observed covariate information (x = a, y = b, z = c) - it's making a prediction for the behavior of ALL individuals in the universe with observed covariate information (x = a, y = b, z = c) .

The column with the strings that will be analyzed is ""CustomerName"".

&amp;#x200B;

Basically: count for number of clients where the full name starts with an upper case ""A"", number of clients where the full name has a lower case ""t"", number of clients where the full name finishes with a lower case ""n"", then the number of clients where the full names don't have any of the previous criteria.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the query in pandas:

&amp;#x200B;

    import pandas as pd;import numpy as np;import re;

    				    'Starts with a capital A',
    				    np.where(df['CustomerName'].str.contains(""t""),
    					  'Has a non-capitalized t',
    					     np.where(df['CustomerName'].str.endswith(""n""),
    						      'Finishes with a non-capitalized n',
    						      'Something else')))
    df_new = df.loc[:,['strings_conditions','CustomerName']].drop_duplicates().dropna()
    
    df_new.groupby(['strings_conditions'])['strings_conditions'].count()

&amp;#x200B;

which gives the following results:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|strings\_conditions|count|
|:-|:-|
|Finishes with a non-capitalized n|100|
|Has a non-capitalized t|288|
|Something else|341|
|Starts with a capital A|64|

&amp;#x200B;

but the same query in SQLite:

&amp;#x200B;

    SELECT 'Finishes with a non-capitalized n' AS strings_conditions, count(*) 
    FROM 
    (
    SELECT CustomerName
    FROM mag_correction

    SELECT CustomerName
    FROM mag_correction
    WHERE mag_correction.CustomerName glob ""*t*""
    GROUP by CustomerName
    )
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT 'Something else' AS strings_conditions, count(*) 
    FROM 
    (
    SELECT CustomerName
    FROM mag_correction
    WHERE mag_correction.CustomerName NOT glob ""A*""
    AND mag_correction.CustomerName NOT glob ""*t*""
    AND mag_correction.CustomerName NOT glob ""*n""
    GROUP by CustomerName
    )
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT 'Starts with a capital A' AS strings_conditions, count(*) 
    FROM 
    (
    SELECT CustomerName
    FROM mag_correction
    WHERE mag_correction.CustomerName glob ""A*""
    GROUP by CustomerName
    )

&amp;#x200B;

gives me:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|strings\_conditions|count|
|:-|:-|
|Finishes with a non-capitalized n|187|
|Has a non-capitalized t|313|
|Something else|341|
|Starts with a capital A|64|

&amp;#x200B;

Would anybody know why this happening? Two of the count results are the same, but I'm don't know where I have gone wrong for the other two.

&amp;#x200B;

If any clarification is needed, I'll happily provide more.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: creating a view in SQLite exactly like df\_new in pandas with the following query:

    SELECT
    CASE 
    WHEN CustomerName glob ""*n"" THEN ""Finishes with a non-capitalized n"" 
    WHEN CustomerName glob ""*t*"" THEN ""Has a non-capitalized t"" 
    WHEN CustomerName NOT glob ""A*""
    AND CustomerName NOT glob ""*t*""
    AND CustomerName NOT glob ""*n""
    THEN ""Something else""
    WHEN CustomerName glob ""A*"" THEN ""Starts with a capital A"" 
    END strings_conditions,
    CustomerName
    FROM mag_correction
    GROUP by CustomerName

Then querying it:

    SELECT df_new.strings_conditions, count(*)
    FROM df_new
    GROUP by df_new.strings_conditions

Gives once again a bunch of different results (except for two rows compared to the other SQLite query):

&amp;#x200B;

|strings\_conditions|count|
|:-|:-|
|Finishes with a non-capitalized n|187|
|Has a non-capitalized t|234|
|Something else|341|
|Starts with a capital A|31|

"I consistently see/hear people advice others - especially early in their careers - not to job hop.

""It will look bad on your resume""

""No one will want to hire you""

""No one becomes VP if they can't show they can stay at one place"".

That may apply in other careers (and honestly, I don't think it does, but whatever) - but ***especially in data science*** it's just terrible, terrible advice.

*Unless your current company is giving you 8% yearly raises and 20%+ comp increases with each promotion, you should be looking for another job within 2 years.*

EDIT: To be clear, if you're not getting 20% increases in comp you should be looking for opportunities that *will* offer you *at least* 20% increases in comp. I'm not saying you should take lateral moves just because you're not getting big enough increases. Make every move count. And you should be able to. 

There are 4 core reasons why:

**Experienced Data Science talent is in incredibly high demand**

If you have 1+ years of legit data science experience, you likely won't have trouble finding companies to offer you a job. I was trying to hire a guy recently who ended up with 4 offers on the table, including one that was 50% higher than the one I gave him. That is what the world is looking like right now.

Which means that even if you're flagged as a ""job hopper"", the reality is that most companies don't have the candidate pool to get picky enough to reject you. They need people. They don't have leverage.

**The fastest way to get a higher-ranking role is to change companies**

This is just basic probability + the previous point. Your company may or may not have a higher role for you to move into (and that's assuming they would even be interested in promoting you). In contrast, there are 100s of companies out there with openings at levels higher than you. Waiting for a role to open up at your company is just a bad gamble.

When I look at people that joined my first job at the same time as I did - and mind you - people I thought were just as if not *more* capable than me - I am now 2/3 titles above them. And it's all because I was able to get bigger titles as I switched jobs.

**The ""job hopper"" red flag is self-correcting**

Say you jump jobs every 6 months 3 times in a row. You would *surely* become a ""job hopper, do not hire"" candidate after that... until you weren't.

See, if no one hires you for a new job for 2, 3, 4 years... eventually someone is going to look at your resume and say ""hey, they job hopped a bunch for a bit, but now they've been at job X for like 3 years... we should give this person a chance"".

For every hiring manager, there is a number Y of consecutive years at one job that will undo whatever previous job-hopping behavior there was prior.

**Internal compensation increases are lower than external ones 99% of the time**

Listen, if your company is giving you 10% yearly raises and 25% promotion raises - by all means, stay. That's a great company.

If you're like the rest of us, getting 2-4% raises and 10-15% comp increases when you get a promotion, and you're getting promoted every 2.5 years on average (or less), then the math just doesn't work out.

Here's some very real data from my 8 year career:

Average total comp increase (without promotion): 2%

Average total comp increase (with promotion): 12%

Average time-till-promotion: 2 years.

Average total comp increase (changing jobs): 28%

If I had stayed at one job for 8 years, my current comp would probably be somewhere around 50%-60% of what it is now - and that is in large part because I took a new job for a 25% raise after being with one company for only 6 months.

Was it risky in that some employers may look at that 6 month tenure as a problem? Probably. But it hasn't stopped at least some substantial number of companies to continue to pursue me.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now, let's pause here. Some of you will say ""well, I applied to one job once and didn't get it, so I know that no one wants to hire me"".

I had a roommate in college that gave me great life advice disguised as terrible dating advice.

His dating advice was ""listen, the reason I get so many girls is that I go out and I hit on 30, 40 girls every night. And every one of them but one will tell me ""no"", but as long as one of them says ""yes"" that's all you need"".

So I never followed that advice for dating, but you should 100% follow it for job searching. There are 100s of jobs out there for which you're qualified. If you're currently employed and in no rush to leave your job, continuously keep applying to any job that you would consider an upgrade over your current one. Obviously make sure the effort is worth the payout - don't go doing week-long take-home assignments for jobs that suck, but pick and choose jobs that are good fits, pay well, look cool, and put some effort into applying for them.

You will get told no a *lot* at first. And then you'll get better at cleaning up your resume, better at interviewing, better at take-homes, etc. Because the only way to get better at those things is to practice.

And then eventually you'll start making it to the final rounds of some interview processes. But probably still get rejected. And then one day you'll get an offer that represents a 40% increase in comp and you'll be sitting there thinking ""wait, what the hell?"".

**TL;DR: job hop aggressively, especially if early in your career. Don't let blanket advice about how job hopping is bad deter you from doing what is going to almost surely be substantial leaps in your career and comp.**

EDIT:

If it wasn't obvious (and maybe it wasn't) there are certainly cases where this advice won't apply.

u/MichaelKamprath pointed out that this may not apply in tech, where you can climb the ladder as an individual contributor and deep expertise may be much more valuable than climbing the management ladder. And I think that is a fair assessment - however one must also recognize this is *not* the case outside of tech where the big salaries are going to come from management roles.

I think it's also fair to say that if compensation isn't a big driver for you - and the quality of the work matters much more, then this may not apply either.",datascience,6252,1136
"This is the first time I did analysis in MBA, I got the result something like:

SUPPORT    |     CONFIDENCE   |   LIFT  |   RULE

1                                  85                    1.2           A==&gt; B

 Does this mean if A is being bought then 85% confidence C will be being purchased too?  If the Lift = 1.2 in the output, then 20% more likely B is to be purchased if A is purchased? 

However, based on mathematical formula, I feel high confidence and support does not imply cause and effect. It's possible that *without A* are more confident likely to have B

This also means LIFT should be the main metrics (LIFT &gt; 1 to indicate the intention correlation). For support and confidence, we just simply need those numbers surpass some small enough threshold. Is that corrected?

"Recently, quite surprisingly for me but the main focus of my work shifted to time-series forecasting.   
I have read a lot in the great book by Hyndman, but I still have a feeling there are a lot of approaches and methods I haven't tried. Currently, my baseline approach is Facebook Prophet to which I add a few custom regressors and try to find the optimal values for the hyperparameters mentioned in the official documentation.   
There are some special traits in the data I work with. Due to how billing is implemented, there are some significant spikes on the 28th of each month and then there might be a sudden drop in the next few days (29-31). Adding regressors helps, but not that much because those values (28-31) might be unexpectedly high or low. 

I have also tried Greykite by Linkedin. This library is quite new and is supposedly better than Prophet at least according to their own blog post. I find it much more challenging and confusing to work with though, and their documentation has yet to be improved in order to be coherent and readable.   
As far as I know, the fancy deep learning models are cool on paper, but because of their non-existent interpretability, high probability of overfitting, and relatively mediocre results in practice, are not used very often.

"Hey guys, if anyone of you has experience with twint, I would greatly appreciate a few tipps here. I tried for like 2 days now to get this working (trial and error, youtube vids and medium articles mostly... I knew nothing about coding before and I might add that I still have no clue)

I have this written down, it describes my main problems:

 

### Command Ran:

import twint  
import pandas

import nest\_asyncio  
nest\_asyncio.apply()

c = twint.Config()  
c.Search = ""EURO2020""  
c.Since = ""2021-06-19""  
c.Until = ""2021-06-20""  
c.Custom = \['time','username','tweet','likes','link'\]   ## &lt;-- This is the problem line  
c.Store\_csv = True  
c.Output = ""Test\_EM2020""

twint.run.Search(c)

### Description of Issue

I am very new to all of this, lets just say that as a disclaimer. I  want to scrape all tweets that happen during specific EURO 2020 football  games. I tried my best to get everything working, but I have no idea  what I am doing to be honest. the pandas, and asyncio line I got form a  YouTube Channel, it doesn't seem to be working if I leave them out, so I  kept them.

The general Scraping seems to work fine, but there are several things that I want to do that give me error messages:

&amp;#x200B;

1. When I try to slim the csv down by only scraping for the stuff i need  (not much, see my c.Custom), I get the message  ""CRITICAL:root:twint.output:\_output:CSV:Error:list indices must be  integers or slices, not str list indices must be integers or slices, not  str"". I have no idea what that means, but I am confused because I am  not asking anything new by my wanted parameters - they are in the csv  when i do not filter, so it doesn't make sense to me why I get an error  message when I look for less attributes.  
 
2. I really want to keep only Englisch and German messages, but the  c.Lang = ""de"" line doesn't seem to be doing anything, same as the  Englisch one. I also do not know how I can combine the two, so looking  only for ""en"" and ""de""  
 
3. Right now what I still need to do is go into Excel and re-format the  first column with the seperators. That does work, but is an extra step  that I am shure can be automated somehow - I just don't know how.  
 

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated. I don't know if this  is the right place to ask, but I found no ""discussion"" forum or  something of the sort. Thanks for reading anyways!

Does anyone have any insights on the program? If I understand correctly, the program is very new and the first cohort of students must be about to graduate now. I would love to read the experience of some people that have taken the program and whether they thought it was worth it as well as any objective opinions in general.

I have found very few first-hand opinions on the MADS at Michigan out there, and the opinions that I have read (mostly here on reddit) were on the negative side. Given that other schools such as Georgia Tech have tons of overwhelmingly positive opinions -both on the quality of the classes as well as the price-, I am scared this is not the right move for me.

* 5+ years of Data Analytics work in large tech company in Bay AreA
* Obtained 2 professional certificates at UC Berkeley Extension: 1 in Programming, 1 in Data Science
   * Medium Proficiency in Python, SQL + Statistics/Probability
* I intend to take degree in 3 years (while working full-time)
* I can afford the tuition (\~$45k before employer contributions) if program is worth it. It won't put me into hardship or debt. 
* What I want to get from the degree: applied knowledge that I can use at the workplace to move onto more technical roles. 
   * Also, a degree that will 'officially' open the doors to the mentioned roles, as many positions state that a Masters Degree is the minimum required qualification.
* If I were to decline the offer, my current options are not many:

"Here's the hypothetical from the interviewer:

FB launched a Zoom-like feature. It was generally well-accepted and its usage is growing.

You work at Instagram. How would you evaluate if IG should add that Zoom-like feature?

(in other words, a synchronous communication app within a heterogeneous network (FB) is being evaluted for launch in an otherwise asynchronous homogenous network (IG).

My response:

Clarifying questions:

\- Can some people use the FB Zoom feature with a higher / different  access level than others?

\- What requirements, minimums, or thresholds must be achieved in order to obtain higher access (such as:

o a Facebook business page,

o a Facebook business page with  &gt;1,000 followers

o a Facebook user with &gt;500 edges (relationships since [Facebook can process one trillion edge graphs)](https://research.fb.com/publications/one-trillion-edges-graph-processing-at-facebook-scale/) which the people (nodes) desiring higher access must have people

\- Higher access might include: the ability to invite more than 20 people (20 being the number the hypothetical provided); the ability to place other companies’ advertisements in the Zoom invitation, the Zoom meeting, and/or the Zoom follow up notification; the ability to place advertisements of the host’s company in the Zoom invitation, the Zoom meeting, and/or the Zoom follow up notification; a longer Zoom meeting time (&gt;60 minutes for example)

(clarifying questions partially answered but  mostly deferred)

I would review the data from the A/B experiment on this feature's usage and adoption at FB. I imagine this A/B test would have a dependent variable / control group / training set in machine learning (ML) (user behavior before Zoom feature) and an independent variable / test group / test set in ML (user behavior after Zoom feature).  user behavior here would include the following variables which would be available in SQL tables for further analysis: frequency (did it increase or decrease after using this feature; in what ways did it increase or decrease (likes, comments, shares, marketplace (buying or selling), direct chat w/ other nodes (users), creation or removal of certain edges (relationships).

I'd also analyze datasets which tracked:

\- how many invitees became hosts and set up their own FB Zoom meeting within 1,2,3,4 and +4 weeks;

\- How many invitees purchased one of the host’s products that were advertised in the Zoom meeting?

\- How many invitees purchased one of the non-host products that were advertised in the Zoom meeting?

The A/B experiment I'd design at IG:

Dependent variable / control group / training set: IG user behavior before Zoom feature

Independent variable / test group / test set: IG user behavior after Zoom feature

user behavior here would include the following variables which would be available in SQL tables for further analysis: frequency (did it increase or decrease after using this feature; in what ways did it increase or decrease (likes, comments, shares, marketplace (buying or selling), direct chat w/ other nodes (users), creation or removal of certain edges (relationships).

Last, I'd run an SQL inner join of the networks of people who used FB Zoom  and the networks of those same people on IG. I'd use clustering ML (entropy weight k-means) to then look for trends or patterns which might explain why the Zoom feature was used more (or less) on FB than IG; which gender uses the Zoom feature more; which network (IG or FB) leads to more Zoom invites being sent out; do IG or FB Zoom meetings lead to more purchases? What type of purchases (category)? What price range? How does price, category and frequency of purchase vary based on GIS or location data of Zoom host and location of invitees? Do the data suggest this might be growing into something like the Influencers feature?",datascience,3851,609

Worked in a bar, two warehouse jobs, and now work in an apprenticeship in a financial services company as a Quality Assurance Analyst. 

As part of my apprenticeship, I take part in courses where they are relevant to our jobs and I was introduced to Data Science which caught my attention. We get told what it is, it’s purpose, the jobs that come under it, and I don’t think I ever felt in love with such a thing before in my life.

But one thing I keep seeing is articles and people saying “How to Become a Data Analyst with No Degree or Experience”. 

This has me interested but also very wary due to the current work climate and strict job requirements. So, I want to ask everyone: Is it really possible to land a job as a Data Analyst with a portfolio background, with no experience, and no degree?

"Hi, I am a CS major. I graduated in 2019 and have been working in a company since then.

When I joined, they had just started an AI team. In fact, my manager was the first data science hire and I was the second one. We have been working on creating an MVP, and don't have any customers for it yet.

My manager is more inclined towards the business side of data science (so he's good in storytelling in demos, working with Sales and Product Management for the requirements etc.). We don't have any expert for guidance on ML product pipelines, algorithm improvement etc. so anything I have implemented so far has been by taking help from the internet.

As a college fresher, I got this job through a Python interview. I even left an offer of 2.5x pay in software development because I wanted to pursue data science.

I haven't interviewed for any other company since then. I don't really know what is usually involved in data science jobs. Have I gained any useful data science experience in order to get the next job?

My work involves:

\- setting up internal products on demo servers and preparing a story through dummy data/insights for customer demos or security conferences (40%)

\- designing database tables and creating reports and dashboards for the product (initially it was in PowerBI, then Jasper Reports and now in an internal product framework) (25%)

\- developing and maintaining Python jobs and integrating model training/detection with the main Java product through Flask (20%)

\- exploring, drawing analogies and implementing unsupervised ML/DL algorithms that can solve the use cases provided by Product Management. (15%)

Back story: I used to work as a government contractor and we were only allowed to attend one conference per year. On that salary, I really couldn’t afford to pay my own way so I only went and presented at one. I recently changed jobs to a small startup, with a 25% pay increase but no real benefits to speak of yet (VERY small and new startup). There’s a conference that is squarely in line with my job description and potentially really important because of both the subject matter and the focus.  The boss is leaning towards only sending one of us and having that person take screenshots. Honestly, I don’t think this is functional for two reasons: 1) if I’m at a conference I want to focus on it and not be taking screenshots like crazy for 4 days, and 2) if I’m not at the conference, screenshots are not going to be useful to me really.  So I’m considering just paying for it myself ($500).  It will mean I can’t get (right away) the new computer I also need for my job, but this conference is really important for both me and the person who signaled it to the boss (and would get to go...that’s only fair and I’m totally ok with it).

"I work on a ""Data Science"" team that does work that is hybrid of typical DS/DE/DA work.

Some days it's simple SQL and Tableau, other times its building pipelines through real time ingestion with kafka or batch ETLs using Airflow, sometimes it's hard statistical analysis and occasionally we do actual Machine Learning... 

We are all Data Scientists by title but play the hybrid of just being good with data, regardless of specifics coming to DA versus DE versus DS..

Recently I've felt like I've been missing the DS side of things. I get the occasional one off request for building data models but don't ever really deploy anything with them... Usually just local models and then sharing the results.

I am wanting to start putting some models ""in production"" as a way to show my usual stakeholders the value that ML can have for the business and I'm curious in all the ways you guys do this on your team? I specifically am curious about two scenarios...

**Scenario 1: Model only needs to be running when the ETL runs.** 

Most of our work is batch processing data at some interval. I typically utilize airflow with kubernetes pod operators to spin up python containers that have the code I need for the ETL. I figured a super simple way to do this was to just store a trained model in the container itself and have the scripts run the models the same way I would locally whenever the airflow job is triggered. This seems simple, but I'm sure my idea is flawed. I know a major limitation here is that to retrain the model, I need to pull my container back to my local machine, retrain the model locally, rebuild the container and push it back to artifactory so the ETL can now use the updated version. There's also the limitation that other people can't use the model since its only present ""in production"" when airflow triggers the pod to spin up.

**Scenario 2: Model needs to be available and running at all times**

I often utilize kafka triggers deployed in kubernetes pods to listen to topics of interest. While they usually just write data to a db or send notifications to stakeholders about the event that occurred, I see a lot of potential in being able to point data from an event into a classification or regression model in real time and then store the results of the model for later use. To do this, I think my approach would be to build a flask API that is deployed in the same kubernetes cluster that I could point my kafka trigger towards... I have played with flask before, but am not as great with the whole devops side in terms of configuring IPs and making sure my flask API is available for other ""apps"" to use...

Asides from the increased workload, this role requires 5 days in-office and the commute is 40+ min one way. There's no plan to move to hybrid in near future. I also have no experience in managing a team, let alone doing that while building out data functions from scratch.

- Download the images/labels to our local machines

Looking at some of the requirements though is making me feel overwhelmed with how much I need to know such as AI, all the different models, coding in at least 3 different languages, DS issues such as underfitting, variance, bias and how to overcome them and other methods and terminologies.

And once I look up these terms and methods I feel like I've forgotten it within a few days, and feel like once I've got an interview or technical questions I'll do really bad in them because I'd have forgotten or don't know.

"Hi, ime doing a course on Data Analysis, so I guess this is the correct place to ask this.

In the course, we were told

* A **hypothesis** is a possible explanation for something, which serves as a starting point for further investigation.
* The **Null Hypothesis** assumes the opposite of what you think is going on – often no change -  and it is your job to disprove it.
* The **Alternate Hypothesis** is usually what you assume,  and can be considered the case with some certainty if the null hypothesis is disproven.

This is confusing me and I think it is just wrong.  

I was doing some research and found [https://microbenotes.com/null-and-alternative-hypothesis/](https://microbenotes.com/null-and-alternative-hypothesis/).

It is saying.

*  The **null hypothesis** is a general statement that states that there is no relationship between two phenomenons under consideration or that there is no association between two groups.
* A **hypothesis**, in general, is an assumption that is yet to be proved with sufficient pieces of evidence. A null hypothesis thus is the hypothesis a researcher is trying to disprove.
* An alternative hypothesis is a statement that describes that there is a relationship between two selected variables in a study.
* An alternative hypothesis is usually used to state that a new theory is preferable to the old one (null hypothesis).

Not sure if I am any less confused.  It seems to be going round in circles.  It feels like the alternative hypothesis and hypothesis are the same, kind on.

So I work for a company based in the U.S. and it has a delivery service for its stores. I basically have the job of identifying which of these stores' delivery service is performing poorly. It's a bitch to do manually because there are hundreds of them and the only tools I have are Excel and the data given to me from the Tableau dashboards made by the data scientists at the company (I have no access to make my own, and was denied previously when asked; Also, I don't even know Tableau that well so I'm sure it wouldn't be any help anyways if I did have access).

My strategy currently is to use metrics such as on time delivery (% of orders delivered on time), and driver delivery rate (% of orders placed that were picked up by drivers). I check the z-scores of these metrics and compare them to the rest of the stores and if it has a z-score less than -2 I highlight it as an outlier. However, since the target metric is 100% for each of these metrics, isn't the data skewed making what I am doing invalid? How can I make difference of mean analyses with skewed data like this? While this framework does capture some of the poor performing stores, its scope is really poor.

# On BigTech

I’d like to provide an overview over the steps of Big Tech companies that recruit for Data Scientist positions in the EU. I will copy this straight from my notes so all of these come from actual interviews. If there’s no salary info it means I didn’t get to discuss it with them because I dropped out of the process for whatever reason before I ended up signing my offer. In total I spoke with around 40 companies and ended up having 3 different offers, went to 6 final round interviews and stopped some processes because I found a great match in the meantime.

**Booking.com**

Salary: €95k + 15pct Bonus

Interviews:

1. Recruiter call
2. Hackerrank test (2 questions, 1 multiple choice, 1 exercise)
3. 2 Technical interviews:
   1. 20 minutes past projects, real case from Booking for solving it,
   2. Second interview: different case, same system
4. Behavorial interview

**Spotify**

Salary: €85-€90k + negotiable bonus

Process:

1. Recruiter call
2. Hiring manager interview, mostly behavorial but there was some exercise on Bayes’ Theorem that involved calculating some probabilities and using conditional + total probability.
3. Technical screening, coding exercise (Python / SQL). SQL was easy but they do ask Leetcode questions!
4. Presentation + Case Study (take home)
5. Modeling exercise
6. Stakeholder interview

**Facebook/Meta (Data Scientist - Product Analytics)**

I lost my notes but the process was very concise! Regardless of the product, their recruitment process was one of the most pleasant ones I’ve had. Also they have TONS of prep material. I think it went down like this:

1. Recruiter call
2. Technical screen SQL, but you can also use Python / pandas. Actually they said they’re flexible so you could probably even ask for doing it in R
3. Product interviews (onsite)

**Zalando**

I did not have any recruiter call, they just sent me an invitation for the tech screen and there would be only 2 steps involved

1. Technical screening with probability brainteaser (Think of dice throwing and expected value of a certain value after N iterations), explaining logistic regression „mathematically“, live coding (in my case implement TF-IDF) and a/b testing case
2. Onsite with 3-4 interviews

**Wolt**

1. Recruiter screen
2. Hiring manager interview, mostly behavioral
3. Take home assignment. This one is BIG, the deadline was 10 days and they wanted an EDA, training &amp; fitting multiple ML models on a classification task, and then also doing a high level presentation for another case without any data
4. Discussion of the take home + technical questions
5. Stakeholder interview

**DoorDash**

1. Recruiter screen
2. Technical screen + Product case. Think of SQL questions in the technical but you can also use R or Python. They ask 4 questions in 30 mins so be quick! Product case is very generic.
3. Onsite interview with mostly product cases and behaviorals

**Delivery Hero**

1. Recruiter interview
2. Hiring manager interview
3. Codility test, SQL + Python
4. Panel interview: 3 people from the team, focus on behavioural
5. Stakeholder interview: largely behavioural
6. Bar raiser interview: this is Amazon style, live coding + technical questions

# Some other mentions:

**Amazon + Uber**

Sorry, they keep ghosting me :D

**Klarna**

Just a hint: they’re hiring as crazy for data science, I got contacted by them but the recruiter didn’t have any positions that would match my level so we didn’t proceed further. I was a bit sad about this because they’re growing, the product is hot and they may IPO soon.

**QuantCo**

Because I have some different 3rd party recruiter in my mailbox every week: They pay very well, I was told the range is up to 230k / y. 140k base + negotiable spread between bonus and equity. They’re not public so I wouldn’t want to sit on their equity. Anyway, I responded twice to that and got ghosted twice from different recruiters. I would recommend ignoring them.

**Revolut**

They contacted me but I decided to not pursue this further because of their horrible reputation and the way their CEO communicates in public.

**Wayfair**

I interviewed with a couple of people who have worked there before as head of something, no one was particularly excited. I applied there once for a senior data analyst position and they sent me an automated 4 hour long codility test. I opened it but decided to drop out of the process.

# On the general salary situation

For senior data science roles outside of big tech I think a reasonable range to end up at is €70k-90k. In big tech you can expect €80-100k base comp + 10-15% bonus / stocks. I’m sure there’s people who can do a lot better but for me this seemed to be my market value. There are some startups I didn’t want to mention here that can pay pretty well because they’re US backed (they acquire a lot recently), but usually their workload is also a lot higher, so it depends how much you value additional money vs WLB.

[levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) is very (!) accurate if the company is big enough for having data there. Should be the case for all big tech companies btw.

# On interview prep

There’s already great content out there!

While I don’t agree with everything here (like working on weekends and being so religious about the prep), I think the JPM top comment summed up how the prep should be done quite well: [https://www.teamblind.com/post/Have-DS-interviews-gotten-harder-in-the-past-few-years-WbYfzXbE](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Have-DS-interviews-gotten-harder-in-the-past-few-years-WbYfzXbE)

I also read this article many times: [https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ox9h2j/two\_months\_of\_virtual\_faangmula\_ds\_interviews/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ox9h2j/two_months_of_virtual_faangmula_ds_interviews/)

I have to say that I started prepping way too late, basically while I was already knee deep into interviewing, but it worked out well anyway.

**SQL:**

Stratascratch is great if you want to practice for a specific company, but Leetcode will prep you more generally imo. I recommend getting a premium for both actually, even though it's expensive. I just took a one-time monthly subscription (be sure to cancel it immediately after booking it as they will just keep charging you).

**Which Leetcode questions to practice:** [https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/)

I honestly didn’t see a lot of Leetcode style questions but they do sometimes ask about it and then you're happy if you recognize the question

**If you need to dive deep into probability theory:** [https://mathstat.slu.edu/\~speegle/\_book/probchapter.html#probabilitybasics](https://mathstat.slu.edu/~speegle/_book/probchapter.html#probabilitybasics). I honestly bombed all probability brainteasers I got asked. It can make you feel stupid but looking back at my undergrad material (which is a veeeeery long time ago) I realized that I was once upon a time able to answer these kinds of questions, I just don’t need them for work. Given that they’re rarely asked I wouldn’t focus on this too much honestly.

**For general machine learning &amp; stats:**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9V07EIfIg&amp;list=PLOg0ngHtcqbPTlZzRHA2ocQZqB1D\_qZ5V&amp;index=1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9V07EIfIg&amp;list=PLOg0ngHtcqbPTlZzRHA2ocQZqB1D_qZ5V&amp;index=1) This video series was my bible. IMO it covers everything you’ll need in data science interviews about machine learning. Honestly, no-one ever asked me anything more complicated than logistic regression or how random forests work on a high level. For reading things up [I also can’t recommend the ISLR book enough](https://www.statlearning.com/)

**On product interviews:**[https://vimeo.com/385283671/ec3432147b](https://vimeo.com/385283671/ec3432147b) I watched this video by Facebook many times. I think if you use their techniques you’ll easily pass most product interviews.

# On recruiter calls

These are really easy imo, in the later stage I had an 80-90% success rate. I made a script for my intro and it took around 4-5 minutes to say everything. This is quite long also because I make sure I speak slowly and clearly when introducing myself, but the structure is the roughly like this:

1. Brief introduction on background + specializations (if you’re really, I mean REALLY good at ML modeling feel free to mention right in the beginning that this is how you’re perceived at work
2. Overview over your current department / team
3. What is your work mode (e.g. cross functional teams, embedded data scientist, data science team)
4. What kind of projects have you worked on
5. What is the scope of those projects (end-to-end, workshops, short projects). It also helps to give a ballpark of their usual timeframe
6. What are your responsibilities in those projects
7. What is your tech-stack / Alternatively: give examples throughout the projects of where you e.g. work with sklearn, pandas, …

I have made great experiences with that. Usually I apologise if I feel that I was going into too much detail or spoke too long, but so far everyone was fine with this and it is imo a great entry point for further discussions. I use this intro also for every other time I meet someone new.

# On hiring manager calls

These are imo quite easy, it’s usually more about the team fit and you shouldn’t have problems if you prepared with the Facebook material. Have some stories about projects ready as they usually ask you about at least 1 or 2 of them. Get familiar with answering questions in the STAR format.

I sometimes made the experience that they’re a bit pushy with their questions. If you feel that they’re focusing a lot on a specific project where you might feel that it’s not the most relevant for the role I recommend leading the direction politely away from there. I sometimes experienced that they were asking many questions about a rather simple model where I also didn’t do any ETL/database work. I recommend saying something in the way of „while surely an ARIMA model is useful, I would like to emphasise that we normally use it as a baseline because it’s easy to explain, but I do prefer increasing the complexity if the project allows for that, as I did for example in project Z. As this was one of my most impactful projects so far I’d love to elaborate on that as well if you’re okay with that, as I want to give you the best possible overview on my skillset and areas of interest.“ If they keep pushing about that not so relevant project I would consider it a red flag honestly and I had such cases before, even though they were very rare.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyn0CKPuPlA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyn0CKPuPlA)

Let me just leave these here.

# On take home assignments

I’ve done a few of them. I learned a lot from them. I hated every single one of them. I hated Leetcode even more in the beginning, but I’ve started to appreciate it, because take homes are just so arbitrary. As I had advanced talks with a couple companies, I skipped more and more of them. At some point I started telling companies that I don’t have time to do them due to other commitments and pending offers. The ones that were enthusiastic about hiring me moved me forward anyway. The ones where I didn’t leave a great impression told me it’s a requirement. So my advice is: If you’re willing to walk away from the process, decline them. It’s not respectful of our time. In one case I told a company that I can’t do it but I’m happy to explain how I’d approach it in detail in a call, otherwise I’d have to withdraw my application. The take home was very extensive, evaluate a large public dataset, do the EDA, fit some models, build an API, dockerize it and show you’ll make a prediction from the worker. They were a bit unorganised and scheduled a meeting about it, but the one evaluating it was super surprised that I didn’t prepare anything. We ended up coding a toy model and deploying it anyway and they forwarded me in the process anyway. Again, I would only recommend this if you’re willing to walk away from the offer, for me this was 50/50.

# On scheduling interviews

In general, bigger companies move slower, but I would suggest mass applying once you’re talking to a few of your favourites. I started practicing on unimportant roles about 1-2 months before I went hardcore with interviewing. I recommend not accepting any offers too early, the market is crazy right now! However, once you have an offer and you had at least a chat with the recruiter or better the hiring manager for a role, even big tech companies can move quickly! After my first offer I had many processes expedited and completed in 2-3 weeks.

# On anything else

Feel free to ask here. As this is a throwaway I won’t check my DM, but I will try to answer any publicly posted questions. Good luck everyone!",datascience,13891,2176
"I am working as a data analyst intern at a company of about 250 people. Since I joined, I am assigned on a project with client which involves working on Tableau for 90% of the time and rest of time it involves working with Big Query.

But at the moment our client is busy with some production project of their own and they don't have much time to discuss their needs with us and hence there is not much work left for us since we are done with what they needed and we have meeting in second week of the next month. Until then, there is literally nothing else on my plate.

So instead of wasting my time, I think I should ask my manager to let me work on a different project which involves some machine learning work. 

But I'm afraid, once our client are done with their project, there will be increase in the work load and I'll end up working on 2 projects which will require me to spend a lot of time of my day out of office hours. Now since I am an intern and just starting out my career in this field, I won't mind some extra work given that it'll only help me grow in the future.

"Resampling is a widely recommended solution to class imbalance among data scientists.  Resampling also is an awful idea.

Resampling is a take on case-control study designs, in which cases/controls are sampled in ways which do not respect the underlying frequency distribution for either cases or controls. When using logistic regression, [the effects are estimated in an unbiased way](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/558942/why-is-it-that-if-you-undersample-or-oversample-you-have-to-calibrate-your-outpu/558950#558950) but the intercept is biased.  

Additionally, [we probably don't want to be doing classification](https://www.fharrell.com/post/classification/) anyway, we mostly want to be accurately predicting risks for the outcome (risk of churn, risk of click through, whatever).  Ensuring our risk estimates are accurate vis a vis calibration and proper scoring rules allows for an appropriate risk threshold to be selected for decision making.  When you resample, all you're doing is forcing the model's probabilities to change in order to make your arbitrary decision boundary look appropriate.  You're putting the cart before the horse.

[Approaches like SMOTE do not help](https://twitter.com/MaartenvSmeden/status/1495668297630633985) (although who the hell would think that all observations within a convex subset of the feature space would all be for one class?  The idea itself is incredibly suspect to me, but I digress).

TL;DR:  Don't resample when classes are imbalanced.  If you have too few observations of one class, ask yourself if the problem is in need of ML.  Otherwise, ensure your probability predictions are calibrated and select an appropriate decision boundary.

So much pointless math for the sake of math. Incredibly tedious computations. Complicated proofs of irrelevant theorems. Psets that require 20 hours or more to complete, simply because the computations are so intense (page-long integrals, etc.). What's the point?

I hit the interview scene starting in January and secured a principal data analyst role at a 1.4B company making a lot more money. This is with their “AI and Digital” business unit.

Has anyone had any experience moving up in company size but down in title? I’m reporting directly to a VP and the next level after principal is director.

Any thoughts?",datascience,601,105
"Hello, I am working on a hospital dataset to predict the cost of a diagnosis. It has around 32 columns with sex, hospital name, city, diagnosis code, Number of days stayed, etc, and finally with the cost. I can use any model as a random forest or decision tree to predict. But I wanna make something different like deep learning models to predict the cost. I know deep learning or neural networks are popular for images. But is there any way to do regressions on tabular data to predict the cost using Deep Learning",datascience,515,94
"Apologies if this is more appropriate for r/statistics

For my job we are planning to model price elasticities over hundreds of products to find out optimal pricing throughout the year and to see if there are price inelastic products. 

I was thinking of doing a basic regression for different price points but have been asked to factor in time periods (Seasonality etc.) and am not sure how to incorporate that into the basic regression model while making it simple for the retail division to understand it.

Is there any method or model that you would recommend? I guess another requirement is that seeing as there will be hundreds if not thousands of products being modelled, the technique should not be too time consuming and computer intensive. Most of the data I have is stored in Spark on Databricks and I work on that so that may give an idea of the limitations of my processing power.

"# Update/TLDR:

This post garnered a lot more support and informative responses than I anticipated - thank you to everyone who contributed.

I thought it would be beneficial to others to summarize the key takeaways.

I compiled top-level notions for your perusal, however, I would still suggest going through the comments as there are a lot of very informative and thought-provoking discussions on these topics.

&amp;#x200B;

**Interview Question:**

&gt;"" What if you run another test for another problem, alpha = .05 and you get a p-value = .04999 and subsequently you run it once more and get a p-value of .05001?""

The question was surrounded around the idea of accepting/rejecting the null hypothesis.  I believe the interviewer was looking for - How I would interpret the results. Why the p-value changed.  Not much additional information or context was given. 

**Suggested Answers:**

* u/bolivlake \- [The Difference Between “Significant” and “Not Significant” is not Itself Statistically Significant](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/signif4.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

* u/LilyTheBet \- Implementing a Bayesian A/B test might yield more transparent results and more practical in business decision making ([https://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-ab-testing.html](https://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-ab-testing.html))

&amp;#x200B;

* u/glauskies \- Practical significance vs statistical significance. A lot of companies look for practical significance. There are cases where you can reject the null but the alternate hypothesis does not lead to any real-world impact.

&amp;#x200B;

* u/dmlane \- I think the key thing the interviewer wanted to see is that you wouldn’t draw different conclusions from the two experiments.

&amp;#x200B;

* u/Cheaptat \- Possible follow-up questions: how expensive would the change this test is designed to measure be? Was the average impact positive for the business, even if questionably measurable? What would the potential drawback of implementing it be? They may well have wanted you to state some assumptions (reasonable ones, perhaps a few key archetypes) and explain what you’d have done.

&amp;#x200B;

* u/seesplease \- Assuming the null hypothesis is true, you have a 1/20 chance of getting a p-value below 0.05. If you test the same hypothesis twice and a p-value around 0.05 both times with an effect size in the same direction, you just witnessed a \~1/400 event assuming the null is true! Therefore, you should reject the null.

&amp;#x200B;

* u/robml  u/-lawnder  \-Bonferroni's Correction. Common practice to avoid data snooping is that you divide the alpha threshold by the number of tests you conduct. So say I conduct 5 tests with an alpha of 0.05, I would test for an individual alpha of 0.01 to try and curtail any random significance.You divide alpha by the number of tests you do. That's your new alpha.

&amp;#x200B;

* u/Coco_Dirichlet \- Note - If you calculate marginal effects/first differences, for some values of X there could be a significant effect on Y.

&amp;#x200B;

* u/spyke252 \- I think they were specifically trying to test knowledge of what p-hacking is in order to avoid it!

&amp;#x200B;

* u/dcfan105 \- an attempt to test if you'd recognize the problem with making a decision based on whether a single probability is below some arbitrary alpha value. Even if we assume that everything else in the study was solid - large sample size, potential confounding variables controlled for, etc., a p value *that* close the alpha value is clearly not very strong evidence, *especially* if a subsequent p value was just slightly above alpha.

&amp;#x200B;

* u/quantpsychguy \- if you ran the test once and got 0.049 and then again and got 0.051, I'm seeing that the data is changing. It might represent drift of the variables (or may just be due to incomplete data you're testing on).

&amp;#x200B;

* u/oldmangandalfstyle \- understanding to be that p-values are useless outside the context of the coefficient/difference. P-values asymptotically approach zero, so in large samples they are worthless. And also the difference between 0.049 and 0.051 is literally nothing meaningful to me outside the context of the effect size. It’s critical to understand that a p-value is strictly a conditional probability that the null is true given the observed relationship. So if it’s just a probability, and not a hard stop heuristic, how does that change your perspective of its utility?

&amp;#x200B;

* u/24BitEraMan \- It might also be that you are attributing a perfectly fine answer to them deciding not to hire you, when they already knew who they wanted to hire and were simply looking for anything to tell you no.

&amp;#x200B;

**Original Post:**

Long story short, after weeks of interviewing, made it to the final rounds, and got rejected because of this very basic question:

Interviewer: Given you run an A/B test and the alpha is .05 and you get a p-value = .01 what do you do (in regards to accepting/rejecting h0 )?

Me: I would reject the null hypothesis.

Interviewer: Ok... what if you run another test for another problem, alpha = .05 and you get a p-value = .04999 and subsequently you run it once more and get a p-value of .05001 ?

Me: If the first test resulted in a p-value of .04999 and the alpha is .05 I would again reject the null hypothesis. I'm not sure I would keep running tests unless I was not confident with the power analysis and or how the tests were being conducted.

Interviewer: What else could it be?

Me: I would really need to understand what went into the test, what is the goal, are we picking the proper variables to test, are we addressing possible confounders? Did we choose the appropriate risk (alpha/beta) , is our sample size large enough, did we sample correctly (simple,random,independent), was our test run long enough?

Anyways he was not satisfied with my answer and wasn't giving me any follow-up questions to maybe steer me into the answer he was looking for and basically ended it there.

I will add I don't have a background in stats so go easy on me, I thought my answers were more or less on the right track and for some reason he was really trying to throw red herrings at me and play ""gotchas"".

Would love to know if I completely missed something obvious, and it was completely valid to reject me. :) Trying to do better next time.

" Hi there, 

I am a medical student conducting some computer vision research and so forgive me if I am a bit off on the technical details. I am in a unique position where I currently have access to two machines: one with a 3080Ti and one with a 3090. I also happen to have an extra 3080Ti on hand.  
 

Currently, I am only performing the following tasks:  
 1.) inference using a CV model on a lot of video data

2.) Training basic NLP models

3.) Some sim racing (although this is obviously less of a hardware priority)

I understand enough (I think) to know that NVLink doesn’t actually matter that much unless you have a GPU cluster, and SLI doesn’t really work across different GPUs? I am basically at the crossroads of how to better parallelize across these 3 GPUs for an optimal setup. Lately I’ve been on the data parallelization route when it comes to inference by splitting my data across machines. I am wondering however, is it worth trading a 3080Ti up for a 3090 to build a dual 3090 NVLink system? Not sure if the model I am using can take advantage of parallelization, but even if it cannot, how often is model parallelization across multi-gpu’s easily accessible/possible?  
 

Additionally, are there any other advantages of this dual 3090 setup in other regards? For sim racing graphics, handling multi-monitors, data pre-processing, handling large datasets, etc….

This is all assuming that doing any other configuration outside of a dual 3090 NVLink setup is not worth it because of efficiency losses of mixing two different GPU’s (which I am also not sure how applicable this is). Also on the first machine with 3080Ti I have a X570 motherboard which I believe would only be able to run a second GPU at 8 PCIe lanes. (I’ve read that this doesn’t actually matter but am unclear about this).

Clearly, I need a little bit of guidance and am just hoping to have a somewhat clearer understanding before I go mess around with a bunch of hardware! Any resources, advice, thoughts would be much appreciated!  
 

Thanks!!!",datascience,2036,353
"As the title already describes I am interest in how you would approach a spatio-temporal forecasting problem.   
I am a data science student, currently doing a project where I want to use time and space features to predict demand.  
In detail: I would like to forecast demand such as taxi demand for a given location and time as for example described in the following [medium article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/new-york-yellow-taxi-demand-prediction-using-machine-learning-fc697d20ff86) using the New York-Taxi Dataset as example.  


I researched the topic a lot and found ton on information ranging from classical approaches which are pure statistical such as ARIMA to using simple and deep machine learning models. Also it seems like there has been a lot of improvement made in the last years since I found a lot of papers dealing with the NYC Taxi Demand Prediction using different models and techniques. The most recent I read were [this one (GSTNet: Global Spatial-Temporal Network for Traffic Flow Prediction)](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/gstnet-global-spatial-temporal-network-for) were they trying to predict the taxi demand using a GSTN model as well as [this one ( Deep Multi-View Spatial-Temporal Network for Taxi Demand Prediction)](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/deep-multi-view-spatial-temporal-network-for) were they combined a CNN for the spatial aspect of the problem and a LSTM for the time problem. Both papers describing the process and achieved stunning results.  


Moreover I found the [DARTS Library by Unit 8](https://github.com/unit8co/darts) which offers a nice tool case for time series problems, however they unfortunately don't seem to include and possibilities for covering space aspects, so using this I would need to train an independent model for each cluster and totally loose and space relations between them.  


My thoughts so far are, that I would first cluster my data based on departures being close to one another. Furthermore I would like to include point of interest data, such as if there are a lot of restaurants or a lot of housing in the given area.   
Moreover I though also on including this information also in my later model.  
So besides passing information only time related, I would like to include also information about the space cluster where the departures happened.  


To round it up, I would be really interested in how you would approach such a problem and how you would make sure that time related features such as weather and space related features such a number of restaurants in the cluster are caputred by your model.  
Would you use a stacking approach to do so, or just go for some fancy model that is able to do both?  


Also if you have any more articles or papers dealing with this, please share (even if I am confident I did my research the past two weeks).",datascience,2850,441

A lot of my team uses SSMS because it's what their used to but both apps are new.

"I have a dataset of text-based documents that I want to cluster. For a sample of this dataset (~10%) I have manually annotated labels (i.e., the ground truth). I would like to cluster this dataset to ""automate"" the annotation of the remainder of dataset. The assumption is that I can not expend the resources to label the rest. I also can't build a classifier with the labeled data because the assumption is that it does not include all possible labels present in the remaining data. I see two options for this:

1. Cluster the entire dataset. Select the clustering algorithm, number of clusters, other parameters by maximizing an external cluster validation index (e.g., ARI) on the labeled sample, thus assuming if the produced clusters conform with the manual labels, the clusters for the unlabeled data should be similarly composed (similar idea of a cluster for this data). 

2. Cluster the labeled sample only. Select the algorithm and other methodological details by maximizing an external cluster validation index. Then, use that method for the entire dataset and select algorithm parameters, number of clusters using a mix of internal validation indices and qualitative review.

Does one of these methods pass the sniff test? I haven't seen this exact use case yet in literature but I'm sure it's out there, just can't seem to find it.

"From my 3-year experience in London fintech as a data scientist working with C-level executives, and from the self-learning journey leading up to that, I’ve created a template to learn the data science skills that companies are looking for.

It’s the template I wish I had when I started learning data science and applying for jobs. You can personalize it to fit your interests and career aspirations.

&amp;#x200B;

My own data science journey started four years ago. I was an unhappy electrical engineer in aerospace. I was looking for something less narrow and more challenging, so I self-learned everything I needed to know about data science. This was a long journey with many detours, but eventually I felt confident enough to start applying, and after a few months I was hired as a data scientist in a vibrant fintech startup in London.

It turned out real-world data science is quite different from what I had studied! I learned about databases, data cleaning, software engineering, but the most challenging was communicating my findings to business stakeholders - both verbally as well as with data visualizations that show a clear message. So I was anxious at first and learned slowly. Eventually I got the hang of it and worked for three years with very hands-on business data, providing real value to C-level decision makers.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a template to self-learn the DS skills companies are looking for, in less time than it took me.

The template is based around 3 pillars:

* Math &amp; Stats
* Software Engineering &amp; Tools
* Data &amp; Business Communication

The Math &amp; Stats section contains a structured list of recommended topics and principles to learn, with links to relevant resources like [Khan](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/modeling-distributions-of-data/normal-distributions-library/v/ck12-org-normal-distribution-problems-qualitative-sense-of-normal-distributions) [Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/confidence-intervals-one-sample/introduction-to-confidence-intervals/v/confidence-intervals-and-margin-of-error) [videos](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors-and-spaces/vectors/v/vector-introduction-linear-algebra) and the classic books like *Introduction to Statistical Learning*).

The Software Engineering &amp; Tools sections walks through tools to learn (based around the Jupyter-Python-Pandas ecosystem), and links to [tutorials](https://www.learnpython.org/), [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyhVh-qRZPA&amp;feature=emb_title), [example notebooks](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks/blob/master/pandas/03.03-Operations-in-Pandas.ipynb) and [cheat sheets](https://startupsventurecapital.com/essential-cheat-sheets-for-machine-learning-and-deep-learning-researchers-efb6a8ebd2e5) (all created by other fantastic people, I take no credit for the linked resources) to learn Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn and Matplotlib.

The Data &amp; Business Communication section is the real core of the template, where both of the previous sections come together. It’s shaped after the process for a typical business data science project:

* Data collection
* Data exploration
* Data cleaning &amp; preparation
* Machine learning modeling: here I mention some common models actually used in businesses, like linear+logistic regression, random forests and timeseries forecasting
* Model evaluation
* Reporting &amp; data visualization: focus on creating clear plots here
* Communicating with stakeholders: this is where I go more in depth on communicating your results to business decision makers, and telling a story which a layman can understand

The study content provided in the template is minimal, but you can go as in-depth as you like with the linked resources. The idea is that you study those resources by yourself, and then write down what you learned in your own words, directly into your own copy of the template.

And of course you can modify this template to your own taste. Delete what doesn’t interest you, and add more where you want to dive deeper.

&amp;#x200B;

I like to learn with flashcards (especially to memorize common interview questions), so I’ve added some example flashcards to help you get started - you can add your own flashcards or delete them if it isn’t for you.

&amp;#x200B;

Here’s the full template in Traverse (my app, with integrated flashcards):

"Full transparency here: my exposure to data science has been by trade, not by formal education or training. That comes with knowledge/terminology gaps, so I apologize in advance for those. If something isn't clicking with you, please feel free to ask clarifying questions and I'll do my best to answer them.

I had an idea for a visualization I wanted to see if there was something out there that does this already in python, or even more fundamentally if there are oversights in my thinking that would blow up this kind of approach from the get-go.

clustering basics: k-centroid clustering starts by selecting k random points and evaluating 'distances' from those k points across the remainder of the dataset. Each data point is then assigned to a 'cluster' based on which of these k points it is closest to.

The problem: those k points are assigned randomly. And we usually get around this by running a clustering exercise repeatedly. But since every single point gets assigned to a cluster, we can end up with points that are 'promiscuous' and end up in different clusters a lot. And I haven't found a good way of visually describing this.

The summary of the proposition: a kind of topographical map, where we first identify k points that are (basically) never in the same cluster. Then we track how frequently each of the various data points are in the same cluster as each of those k points. So if K1 and point 56,757 are in the same cluster 95% of the time, that pairing has a height of 0.95. And if K2 and point 5,251 are in the same cluster 50% of the time, that pairing has a height of 0.5.

So then we take the set of K that are most exclusive to each other, make a pair of orthogonal eigenvectors out of them and pretend that these are new axes. Then we plot the full dataset onto these new axes and then treat the frequency of how often those points are paired together as the 'height' of the relationship.

Then, I think, we have a topographical map. Setting a threshold of how frequently point-to-centroid pairs share a cluster is essentially like setting the sea level of this topographical map, and there's probably some curve that identifies how much information we lose for each 0.01 of the 'sea level' and then we can probably fit some half-dozen different kinds of optimization algorithms there to find out the 'ideal' height.

The resulting ""islands"" are your new, improved, and focused clusters, with 'promiscuous' data points underwater.",datascience,2463,431
"Let’s say I’m doing a product cannibalization analysis. Product X sales decrease from Year 1 to Year 2, while a new Product Y which was introduced in Year 1 experience sales growth during the Year 1 to Year 2 period. I want to calculate the product cannibalization rate which should in theory be (sales decrease of Product X)/(sales increase of Product Y) but this is assuming that all of my sales lost in Product X went to Product Y, but if I did a correlation analysis, I see that the correlation coefficient is around -0.7 instead of a perfect -1.0 negative correlation. Would I be able to apply a factor of 0.7 to my cannibalization rate since it seems only 70% of the movement in sales is tied to the products and not other factors? Am I looking at this correctly or does this not make any sense?",datascience,801,148
"Say I have some network traffic data, and I see that usually user A logs in 5-10 times a week into the network. Suddenly if one day I see 50-100 logins from that user, that is suspicious activity, right? Maybe the user was hacked, etc.

What is this kind of analysis called, where there is no label column in the dataset stating that this traffic instance is normal or anomalous; but rather, we need to model what is normal vs anomalous based on frequency of occurrence?

"I'm rather fresh in the DS field and so is the company that I work for.

Anyway, rant aside, how do you handle project requests? Do you send out a form to the business units and ask them to outline exactly what they want? I'm also wildly unfamiliar with a lot of the data that we have so sometimes it takes a long time to find out if we even have the right data. Is this normal?

"I've been in the ""data"" field for few years after previously training in a clinical area but never quite got the ""data scientist"" title-have been working as a statistician, then an analyst and really became advanced in my coding/programming skills over the course of the last few years. I realize I enjoy programming and could envision coding all day. My most recent job ended up being less analysis and modeling and more 'using code so I never have to do manual work again'-some of it sucked b/c but it was also rewarding to figure out how to write scripts for stuff people were doing manually for years.

However, I a pretty common theme I honestly felt in my last few jobs is that I quickly lost sight as to what I was doing because the people overseeing the projects seemed to have a lack of clear goals in their work. My work was basically centered around ad-hoc requests from people-sometimes unrealistic requests, it became repetitive and boring and everything felt like we were just doing things for the sake of doing them. 

I started applying to jobs both in my original field and data science roles in tech with the hopes I can do a job where at minimum I know what I'm supposed to be doing everyday and ended up getting got an offer at a place I originally applied for in a clinical role but ended up in a bit of a random role where I am neither doing data science (b/c they already have a team of pretty talented people who are coding, creating dashboards and modeling) or clinical work-I'm basically an in between person coming up with 'new ideas' and measures-it's really up to me to define the role. The thing is there are some clinical people who know what they are looking for when it comes to data, so it's basically right now a pipeline between them and the data team and I don't know where I fit in the puzzle. The people I work with so far are great and I do think it's nice to have the freedom of trying something new, but I feel very limited-I don't have access to the data which the data team does and they probably won't prioritize me getting access since I'm not on that team. I've been coming up with projects that aren't dashboards, but I sort of feel like I'm getting that 'doing for the sake of doing' feeling. 

I'm assuming (from some posts here) some of you have felt this way-any tips to navigate? I'm allocating some time to self-teaching and doing side projects so I still feel like I can be a part of the data world, but funnily I feel overwhelmed from being a bit underwhelmed and could use some insight how to better navigate that.

Thank you.",datascience,2583,476
"I’m in a undergraduate Bayesian statistics course. Thus far we have learned three cases of conjugate Bayesian models:

Beta binomial, normal normal, gamma poisson.

I’m wondering how often these specific cases, or in other words, conjugate Bayesian models are easy to apply in practice. As in, with knowledge equipped from these three conjugate models, can I solve a wide variety of problems? Or in practice is it more about specifying custom likelihoods and mixing and matching priors and likelihoods to get what I want? 

Is just knowing these three models well enough to be dangerous with using Bayesian methods in practice? What more would I need to know?",datascience,659,108

"Hi all! I've been talking to many folks lately about dealing with code quality in Jupyter notebooks, and I'd like to hear the perspective of the r/datascience community. To get started, here are a few things I've heard:

1. **Allow Jupyter notebooks but refactor them before deployment.** This is the most common answer, people are allowed to use notebooks but before deployment, there is a big refactoring process where the notebook is converted into scripts or functions. One problem I see with this approach is that it's slow and error-prone, sometimes results from the original notebook cannot be reproduced.
2. **Deploy notebooks as-is.** This is an interesting approach, teams execute notebooks in production. I think it works ok for simple projects (e.g. notebooks with &lt; 100 cells) but it gets difficult to maintain for larger projects.
3. **Ban the use of Jupyter notebooks.** Pretty strict IMO, what ends up happening is that a lot of code lives outside the git repository and gets lost there. This approach forces Jupyter users to refactor their code before merging it into the codebase.
4. **Use jupytext and write small notebooks.** This is a pretty rare answer (because many people don't know about jupytext yet). but I think it's a great solution: jupytext essentially allows you to open .py files as notebooks so can edit the code in Jupyter but version it with git without issues. The main caveat here is that although it enables code reviews, it doesn't fully solve the problem, and the notebooks/scripts may still have some hidden state. [This is my current approach; I wrote about it here.](https://ploomber.io/blog/nbs-production/)

"Working in medical field, we regularly see datasets that contain variables with coded values. For example like this:

    Number biopsies for research, max. 3 (standardmatsamples)
    1 = 1
    2 = 2
    3 = 3

    1 = 0  
    2 = 1  
    3 = 2  
    4 = 3  
    5 = 4  
    6 = 5
