"I'm hosting a free workshop this Friday, 11am-12pm EST for those who want to learn the framework for using SQL, Tableau, and Excel in a business context, by demo-ing how to build a portfolio project that represents a project you would work on the first 3-6 months of a data analyst job. The project is based on my years of being a data analyst (currently director in data), hiring analysts across 4 companies, and being a bootcamp instructor.

"GT's MS in Analytics is $9900 while UC Berkeley is $75K. Both are remote and part time studies.

Does anyone know what such a massive gap? I know Berkley is the bigger name, but are you really just paying for that or is their a higher quality in the content?

Anyone look into both and can shed some light? Just from a quick search it seems a few people here did the GT program and I didn't read many complaints. Does a degree from GT hold any water in the job market?

Since I can really only do remote, the networking aspect is a moot point for me. It's really just checking off a box when applying to roles.

"I work in product analytics/ DS at a tech company on a consumer-facing application with various flavors (web, iOS, android, etc…). Our business is highly volatile and driven by world events so significant seasonality and huge single day swings are common around major events.


We have faced a number of product issues recently and want to stand up monitoring across a large number of metrics related to user activity and user flows. The challenge is that our business is highly volatile and identifying “problematic” trends is really difficult. I want to stand up some kind of model to identify metrics that are moving in unexpected ways. In a way, I’m looking for “outliers” but I don’t want the daily spikes that occur to cause every metric to be flagged that day.


An example to better illustrate…

We recently identified an issue with Android login screens freezing on certain app versions. This issue started the same week as a major volume spike driven by a specific annual event.

-	Due to the volume spike, overall login volume was still up day over day (so no issue detected)
-	Android-only login volume was still slightly up (so no issue detected)
-	Volume for those specific App versions was down slightly from previous days. This didn’t look like a problem without the context that all correlated measures had spike while it did not. This is how we found the issue but was only caught through sheer dumb luck.



Essentially, I have a large system of metrics for all user flows and actions. They are all correlated to some degree and all experience significant volatility. Reviewing and cutting these metrics daily would be a full time job and is not feasible.


So what I’m trying to accomplish… I want to create a model or algorithm to assess metrics on a daily basis and assign a “risk score” of sorts for those who have moved in an unexpected way based on their historical time series and the behavior of all other correlated metrics on that day. Essentially, I want to identify any “anomalies” that occurred that day.

"Hi to all,
I just graduated in Data Science after a period of stop from studies and for a year I started again and graduated. 

Due to the poor quality of the courses I took, the lack of interesting projects in the exams, and also a bit my fault, for not trying to get passionate about the main courses a data scientist relies on, such as statistics, I feel UNPREPARED for the world of work. 

I love AI, specifically NLP and computer vision but I feel I need to study most of the statistical concepts again before i can try some interviews in a safer way.

"I have a problem where I'm following individuals over time and collecting data once a week on two continuous variables that I eventually turn into a proportion. 

I establish a 4-week baseline and then have a 4-week test period with a test group of 100 individuals and 100 matched controls. 

I want to calculate the difference in this proportion metric between test and control group but unsure how to unbiasedly calculate this. 

Do I consider the data points the converted proportion metric or do I utilize the absolute values for the numerator and denominator? I guess a related question is where do I aggregate and where do I average as I lose some information on the absolute metrics when I start averaging the proportion metric.

I personally like the beach/startup/chill vibe of UCSD better, though I hear this can also be found at UCI. UCI just seems less exciting to me.

From a dataset building and collection standpoint I thought it was awesome just because I managed to organize and aggregate so much owned and paid marketing data. 

From a modeling standpoint I thought it was complete bull shit. I built a Bayesian model and the marketers I worked with did not even care about the results of the model. They already knew what values they were looking for in terms of contribution and ROAS and once the model was built a lot of the work that was done was simply to keep adjusting the priors until it matched what the marketers wanted.

"I am trying to build a classifier that will classify a movie into a main genre (About 8 different categories) based on two given features. Namely, subgenre and movie name. While working on this, I encountered a few challenges and would like some feedback and direction about how to approach this. First, is the issue regarding encoding the sub and main genres. I thought of using OneHotEncoder but I would have a really wide dataset. Given that I would have to also vectorize the movie names. A potential workaround would be to group some subgenres together and reduce the 100+ categories. Second, would LabelEncoding the main genre category be the correct approach? Additionally, Given that many movie names have almost very little meaningful information would it still be a good idea to use them regardless? For example, ""Finding Hank"" when preprocessed would just be ""Hank"".

The approach thus far:

1). Preprocessed movie names ( Removed stop words and Stemmed)

2). Vectorized Movie names

3). Encoded Sub genre with OneHotEncoder

4). Encoded Main genre with LabelEncoder

5). Tried to fix model = Disaster.

"I'm an experienced(4yrs) data scientist looking to transition  to machine learning engineering. I'm making top dollar in my role level and area. I had the chance to do some machine learning engineering projects in my previous company(series D) and I loved it. Especially learning how to optimize code to make it use lesser resources or to make it faster, cloud resources to use, choosing the right deployment tool, etc. I got laid off from that company and currently working in a new one. It's a startup with 2016 data infrastructure. It's a good opportunity to shake things up a bit here but management is tight on budget right now. I received an offer from a company with a mature data stack. However, my pay will drop by 18-35% depending on how negotiations go. I am aware that I am earning a lot more than average based on skill and level in my role and area. Considering that, if I had the average pay, I'd have a drop of 9%-18% in annual salary. Compared to my previous company annual salary it's a bump of 12%.

 I find the offer as a decent opportunity to start my machine learning engineer career since machine learning jobs in my area are scarce. The number of local tech companies doing it are less than 10. Others are already offshore consultancy based. However, I don't know if switching jobs is going to be worth it. I specialize in developing NLP and information retrieval systems. The new job will be a mix of fraud and machine learning engineering. I've had 1.5 years of experience on SWE and SysAd before I went to DS.

We did so, and they complained that the numbers percentage points add up to 98%.

We explained that it's because of rounding, and if we included the decimal it would add up to 100%.

They started going on about how they present this to CFOs and they'll ask why it doesn't add up to 100% and it has to be perfect and etc.

So we offered to show the decimal, but nope, can't do that because it's ""hard to read.""

Remember how they produce those manually at the moment? They said, and I quote, ""sometimes I change a 3% to a 4% to make it work, because what's 1% more?""

" Hey r/datascience. 

I come from a business background and over the years have slowly made my way to data analysis and now moving to data science. However, one thing I noticed from other professionals that come from a computer science background is their more intricate knowledge of the tools and their interactions. Mid 2000's. after getting tired of Excel + VBA I started working with SQL. When programming languages became a necessity for my work, I learned Python (also some JavaScript, but that's not here nor there). after getting to the point I needed more number crunching and statistical approaches, I learned R. I don't consider myself an expert, but I at least understand the tools.... separately, at least. Now that I'm formally doing my masters, more than once I have been jumping from software to software, not to mention when doing collaborations (all my work so far was done by me and for me, only the insights and reports needed to be shared, so no one else ever worked on my codes), I have no idea on how to setup everything.   

So, I came here to ask: What is a good workflow and best practices to start with? Currently, most of my work is done either on PyCharm (for more complex coding), Jupiter (for EDA) and RStudio (for R). Regarding git and GitHub, I only ever used it through RStudio (other than the bash shell, of course). However, is there go-to approach where I can use the same tool for everything (or for most part of it)? I know how to do what I need, just not an efficient way to do it specially if I have to work with others.",Help with workflow and best practices,datascience

I am most likely going to transition from my current data scientist role into a data analytics role because it aligns better with my interests and skillset.

My current role is an Associate-level Data Scientist, and my target role will be a Senior-level Data Analyst. Again, **I know there are a lot of variables at play here**, but in a very general sense, what do people think I should expect salary-wise? A slight decrease? Slight increase? Roughly the same?

Let's assume we will run an experiment where CTR is our primary metric, and that our experiment will allocate/sample on a user-level

What is the proper way to do this, given ad data is typically on an impression level?

My thoughts:

aggregate on a user-level, where columns are # of impressions, # of clicks, and ctr of each user

your metric is now continuous since it is ctr of each user, and you can calculate the weighted stdev/variance.

So what should my CV look like considering I have no prior work experience, what kinds of projects would you recommend doing (I've heard a diverse set of projects but what would you consider diverse enough to cover what I need).

What would coding interviews be like, is it a lot of DSA and how would you prepare for the interview?

Also, what does the workplace environment feel like? Is it really as hard as when y'all were in university? I've heard it becomes easier, and also you end up picking up more when you're on the job.

"I spent my first few months post-graduation deciding whether to pursue data science or SWE. I ultimately chose the former as it better aligned with my background, but I quickly learned data scientist is not an entry-level role and I must choose something else.

I’ve heard data analyst is a good place to start if you want to become a data scientist, but I’m not too sure if this role is for me. I want to code, work with APIs, scrape the web, automate processes, and develop tools that people can use and I fear that in going the data analyst route, I will be regulated to a very specific set of tasks/tools (e.g., excel), and not be able to do so much of what I enjoy about data science and coding in general.

I’m now considering software developer roles, particularly python developer one, as a means to becoming a data scientist, because I've read this role allows you to do all that I mentioned above. My only qualm is that I don't see python developer to data science paths often (let alone python developer roles), and I'm not sure how to market myself as someone who aspires to become a data scientist but is currently a developer (am I just a developer? A data professional? both?).

Has anyone made the transition from developer to data scientist? What role did you begin with and how did it facilitate your path to a data science role? Are there any other coding-centric roles aside from Python developer that can segue you to data science that I may be missing?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!",(Python) developer role as path to data science?,datascience

"Current freshman studying data science in the US. I just applied to this opportunity and got accepted but not sure if it'll be worth it in the long run. Here are the main components of it:

* foreign language study (12 credits prior to going abroad)
* a domestic internship/research experience (typically in the summer after your sophomore year)
* a semester of study abroad (fall or spring of my junior year)
* an international internship/research experience (typically in the summer after your junior year)
* a ""global design team project"" (not entirely sure what this means)

"I'm a recent CS graduate from a Canadian university. In my degree, I took a course in ML and also did my capstone project on DL-generated music. Based on this, I decided I want to learn more about it and pursue a career in DS/ML. In terms of experience, I just have some contract work, and I'm currently working as a research assistant, helping a few profs out with a literature search on AI in healthcare. Based on this, I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for someone like me looking to enter the field?

I've since realized that data science may be the way to go, as it seems any ML positions often require a graduate degree and years of experience. However, I'm finding the same thing with applying to data science jobs. For the jobs that don't ask for years of experience, I often meet all the requirements, however, it's pretty common to find 'entry' level positions asking for 3-5 years of experience... I've had one interview for a data scientist internship at a local company, which I was certain I would get after the interview, but I haven't heard back from them. I'm also finding that I'm not alone in experiencing this. Browsing other posts, I can see that even senior data scientists are having trouble getting hired, which is worrisome. 

I should also mention that I've applied to OMSCS and will likely be accepted. However, my plan was not to start graduate school until after I had worked for about a year in the field. In fact, I'm not 100% tied to the master's at all. I think it's a great option, but I'm also open to working my way up in the industry, aiming to eventually land a job doing applied machine learning.

"*\[Scroll for TLDR\]*

I'm facing a dilemma of choosing between two great schools for my Masters. But the programs are pretty different from each other. I don't know what factors to prioritize. One of my primary objectives is bagging a very **high-paying role** immediately after grad, and continued rapid growth in the next 3 years. I'm an international, and H1B visa is dicey nowadays - I must speedily recover the **\~$110k** I'd be spending at any of the two institutions.

**Bonus comparison** : I also have a **DS** Admit from **University of Rochester**, which will cost me half (with 25% scholarship). Its reviews are all fine, nothing extra-ordinarily good or bad. Could get DS jobs from there too. But isn't in the same league. 

**Brief background** : I have 3 years of experience in Applied Deep Learning research (title being Data Scientist though) and a couple of papers in Vision and RL. I'm extremely fascinated about AGI and concerned for the Safety and Alignment of advanced Intelligence. I have **No** experience in production/deployment or traditional Data Science/analytics/stats. I also hold an MS in Physics and BE in Mechanical Engineering from a premier institute in my country, but with a pretty bad GPA (7/10).

&amp;#x200B;

[**MS Data Science at Columbia**](https://datascience.columbia.edu/education/programs/m-s-in-data-science/)**:**

**Pros**:

* Ivy League, enjoys prestige across the world, including my country, if I return.
* In Manhattan, so a lot of companies come for career fairs. Wouldn't have to move much.
* Alumni in general seem to be well placed in Industry, not necessarily in proper ML roles though.
* Has a nice Effective Altruism student chapter, focuses on AI Safety etc.

**Cons**:

* **Extremely** [**Shitty core curriculum**](https://datascience.columbia.edu/education/programs/m-s-in-data-science/#curriculum) \- just 3 basic applied stats and 3 basic CS courses thrown together. No real data science or machine learning.
* Unimpressive choice of electives- More parallel to an analytics degree.
* Only 3 electives allowed. Applied ML and DL are electives and not core, so will occupy 2 spaces.
* Needlessly terse and theoretically rigorous. People do have trouble keeping up.
* Living in the hustle-bustle of costly NYC can be a pain.
* **200-250+ batch** size, can lead to higher competition.
* People here all have 9.2+ /10 GPA in undergrad. I got admitted somehow at 7, probably historic. May not fare well or fit with the kind of perseverant students here.  Also heard most here are pretty snobby and elitist.
* Grade deflation, so may lag behind in class, I'm not hard-working at all.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[**MS Artificial Intelligence at Northwestern**](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/artificial-intelligence/overview/)**:**

**Pros:**

* Also enjoys a very high repute, and a Top 10 US News National Universities rank (Does it matter?)
* **Excellent** [**core curriculum**](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/artificial-intelligence/curriculum/msai-traditional.html). Proper ML, DL, AI, NLP, HCI courses with great syllabi covering breadth of AI.
* [**GOD-TIER electives**](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/artificial-intelligence/curriculum/courses.html), long list from Modern DL, core CS, advanced Robotics, PM, what not. One I was boggled by was ""[Artificial Life](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jURIbvpQ0imcaMk-AHUmj_szZNtsA4lZAlcqXa6usXs/edit)"". Many other dreamy, futuristic courses (but not hand-wavy). Some courses also cover [Superintelligence](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/artificial-intelligence/curriculum/descriptions/comp-sci-496-23.html) and other AI Safety stuff.
* Most courses like Deep Generative Models, RL, Artificial Vision etc are updated with the current **state-of-the-art**. The NLP core course also has 30 papers to read from 1950s to GPT-3. Has many other seminar-based PhD level courses too.
* Does not focus too much on maths/stats apart from a few Data Science related courses, just enough theoretical and formal depth in most courses.
* Most courses have a significant project component (usually free to choose), and regular assignments involving the latest frameworks and architectures . PyTorch is used throughout the curriculum.
* Lots of industry seminars, projects etc. Generally good industrial connections. Companies come and give projects, can also sometimes convert to full-time/internships.
* Can also take Entrepreneurship and other great courses from the amazing Kellogg school.
* Only **40 people cohort**. Uni is more responsive to needs of the batch and each individual.
* Grade Inflation, so no worries about performing better relative to others.
* Meticulously selected 40 students with generally 3+ years of experience in AI : so elevated rigour of projects and more to learn from others, stronger personal connections (though I'm an introvert).
* Evanston is a more placid and calm place to get lost in studies for 1.3 years.

**Cons**:

* The AI program is newer and not as well-known, or considered a feeder into the industry yet. I don't know if the repute of Northwestern in the industry matches Columbia or falls short enough to make a difference (or exceeds??). The alumni seem not as well-placed but difficult to judge ratios etc. from linkedin.
* The research prowess of the dept isn't as great (evident by cs-rankings). The proffs at NU aren't well-established as AI researchers. The teaching is also sometimes underwhelming from what I heard from current students. But I'm a self-learner anyway, will do with Stanford/UCB lectures.
* Could be a really heavy courseload as well, since it's a quarter system with about 4-5 courses each quarter. Would want to take even more since there's no extra cost to add the lovely electives.
* Evanston/even Chicago isn't really a great place to be for Tech ? I'd have to relocate to NYC/SF later. Though I do love Chicago from its beautiful pictures, the crime-rate could be a concern.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR : Curriculum vs Prestige?

That is, **If** there is a significant prestige difference b/w NU and Columbia, and **if** it matters and plays an actual physical role in an ML/AI career. Also, does NYC play any real role (Isn't networking virtual anyways?)

Imho there's nothing good with Columbia DS apart from recognition, and NU's AI curriculum is one of the greatest in the world. But finally, I would need a job, and for that Columbia may have higher mileage. NU may give me cool AI stuff to chew on for my life though and lead to desired opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

**Did I aim too low ?**

I'm oscillating between disbelief/ imposter syndrome at getting these admits, and regretting not applying to **Berkeley/Stanford/CMU** etc. I had passed most deadlines when I started to apply (this Feb). 

I was told I wouldn't get anywhere at all due to my poor grades, misaligned background, and super-late timing of applications. Removed and added NU and Columbia from my final shortlist multiple times, coz never thought I'd get in. NU already seemed full, they had specifically instructed to not apply after Dec 15, if you want to be considered fully, lol. Only a handful of expensive Unis's deadlines remained by March, which became my automatic shortlist.

I work in a slow paced environment, where I feel my skills are kind of wasted and haven’t really been developing much lately. The biggest issues are the lack of data and the fact that I am basically the only data scientist in the company.

"Hey guys,

It is difficult enough to land any interviews at all rn, but then you have to deal with the recruiters who cannot even do their jobs. I recently had a negative experience with Capital One for a data science position. Details are below:

* I was reached out by a recruiter from C1 about 2 weeks ago, asking for my availability for a 30 mins interview. I responded within that day my availability for that week and the week after.
* Recruiter responded 5 days later, agreeing to schedule a call at 3PM the day after
* The day after, recruiter sent me an email right before the call, saying that he needed to push back the call to the next day. I agreed and provided him with my availability for that day. Recruiter did not send any confirmation response.
* The day after that, recruiter emailed me at 2:40PM, asking me if he could call at 3PM. I was in a meeting at the time, but still agreed to take the call and left the meeting early.
* Recruiter never called at 3PM. He sent an email at 4:30PM stating that “something came up that was very time-sensitive,” without any apology, and offered to reschedule for 6 PM that day or the next day. Again, I replied with an agreement to take the call at 6PM
* Recruiter never called at 6PM.
* The next day, I sent another email to recruiter, but this time, I copied Capital One's main careers/HR email address. He called me within a minute after I sent the email (lol).
* The call lasted for 5 mins, for what was supposed to be a 30 mins call. He asked me basic questions like salary expectations, and relocation. I was not even asked ""Do you have any other questions about this role?""
* Recruiter said he would forward my resume to 2 hiring managers, and would let me know what they think. I asked for the hiring manager's names, and he said he would send me their linkedin profiles in a follow-up email.
* Of course, I never received this follow-up email. I sent him an email asking for the hiring managers' contact info. He never replied.
* Early morning the next day, I received a rejection email. Mind you, our call was around 5PM the previous day. This made me wonder whether my resume was ever forwarded to the hiring managers at all.

TL,DR: Was flaked on 3 times by C1's recruiter. Finally got a super brief call because I copied the main HR email address in the chain. Got rejected the next day.

 ***(correct me If im wrong), what a dot product does, is its give us a number, showing how much two vector points are close to each other.***

So, by doing dot product in step2 we are just checking distance of all points from 2\*2 matric vectors,

" I'm working on a binary classification problem and need some help in evaluating my model's performance. I have two datasets, 'train' and 'test', and my dataset has a large number of features. I used UMAP with n\_components=2 to reduce the dimensions and plotted the points.

I found that there are distinct regions where the majority of points are either class 0 or 1, suggesting that my model should be able to classify them easily. However, there is an area where the two labels overlap, making it more challenging for my model to predict the correct class.

In this overlapping region, there are many training samples but very few test samples. As a result, my model achieves an F1 score of 0.75 for the training set and 0.96 for the test set, which are significantly different.

Here's an image of the distribution of train and test points with 1 being train samples and 0 being test samples.

* Binary classification problem: Active (A), Non Active (B)

I've been working on an ML approach for tabular tasks (up to \~10K rows, 100 columns, no text) that seems to yield results in seconds, outperforming an XGBoost model tuned for an hour. I'd love to hear your thoughts and get your input on how to make this more useful for all of us.

My goal is to create a tool that becomes an indispensable first step for anyone working with tabular data that is not humongous. To make it as useful as possible, I'd appreciate your insights on the following:

1. **Your experiences**: What challenges do you face when working with tabular data? Do you see any potential use cases for this approach in your work? I'd love to learn from your experiences and see how this solution can help address your needs.
2. **Collaborative testing**: If you have a small dataset and are open to sharing it, I'd be excited to collaborate with you. We can work together to optimize the solution for your specific application while ensuring data privacy and confidentiality.

"Apologies for cross-posting with /r/Python, but this is particularly relevant to many data science practitioners.

We're excited to announce the release of a new data visualization toolkit: Highcharts for Python! 

It's a collection of Python libraries designed to provide turn-key comprehensive support for Highcharts data visualizations in Python, including native integrations with Pandas, Jupyter, PySpark, GeoPandas, ESRI, and more. If you're unfamiliar with Highcharts, it is one of the leading Javascript data visualization solutions, used to easily create highly interactive, beautifully styled data visualizations with over 150 different chart types. Using the Highcharts for Python toolkit, you can easily integrate this rich set of visualization capabilities into your Notebooks and analytical apps.

The toolkit includes full support for the Highcharts suite of data visualization libraries, including Highcharts Core, Highcharts Stock, Highcharts Maps, and Highcharts Gantt. Full disclosure, the libraries are free to try, but like all of the Highcharts visualization products, using them commercially requires a license with extensive (human) support. 

You can find the Github repos for the full toolkit at [https://github.com/highcharts-for-python](https://github.com/highcharts-for-python), more details about what the toolkit can do at [https://highchartspython.com/integrations/python](https://highchartspython.com/integrations/python), and extensive documentation at [https://highchartspython.com/get-help](https://highchartspython.com/get-help).

"I got accepted into three graduate DS programs: Applied Data Science at USC, Data Science at U. of Rochester, and Data Science at Vanderbilt. 

It's very exciting to receive offers from all three, but I'm having a headache trying to figure out which one would be the best choice for my future.  

&amp;#x200B;

Let me give you a bit of background about myself. 

I don't have any education or career background in DS. I've worked in a different area for a couple of years but got attracted to DS. So I don't have much knowledge in programming and still exploring sectors where I want to work. (IT and Energy seem interesting though.)

When I think about USC, I feel it would give me more opportunities in the field considering its location and reputation. California is known for IT and Energy Industry, and I've heard USC has a great network. 

Vanderbilt is also an amazing school and what I like about their program is that they provide introduction courses. As I'm a complete novice, I think that would be important to consider..? (If you have a similar experience, please share your experience)

U of R is the best from the financial perspective as they've offered a 50% scholarship. The tuition goes down to 35K+ while USC and Vanderbilt are 78K, 100K. Considering the high living costs in LA and Nashville, I guess the cost of getting a diploma from these two schools would be way more expensive...

" Hey all,

I need to predict when a machine will hit a threshold for wear amount (The machine will be replaced once the threshold is met), where the current wear of the machine is measured about once a month. One of the biggest causes of wear is when the machine is in use, which happens a couple times a month. There are also other factors which affect this machine's wear rate, including temperature, ect.

By looking at the scatter graph of wear amount against time, it looks to be mostly linear, although the rate is different depending on which machine I am looking at (because of the previously mentioned wear rate factors), the rate for one machine also periodically changes based on other factors not mentioned.

I was going to go down the RUL approach for this problem with Survival Analysis, however before I do this, I was wondering if anyone had any advice or a better approach to use (neural network or some other form of regression). Since the current wear amount is not measured very frequently, how should the input data for the model be structured to account for these gaps of data?

* MLE leaning roles will ask for knowledge on how to productize DS projects. Knowledge of AWS and containers is sort of expected.
* DS roles expect at least some idea of how neural networks work, sometimes how transformers work.

I've read some interesting literature about how these types of random forest models can be thought of as an adaptive nearest neighbor approach which ""learns"" which features are most important in determining neighborhoods, rather than just using a standard distance calc across all features.

There are lots of tools around determining which features are important (SHAP values, feature importances, etc.), but I was wondering if there was a way to use these models to determine the most similar data points based on this adaptive neighborhood idea (i.e. something like how many leaves they are in together, or % of times they are on the same side of a split, etc.).

I know I can compare on the actual output, but I was also thinking there would be cases where different subgroups might have similar outcomes spuriously despite having different features (i.e. w.r.t. housing price regression: small shore houses having similar price ranges to large suburban homes, despite being very different).

I frankly don’t know how anyone could have my unique combination of requirements to meet this role. The concern I have is that I’m interviewing with folks that are all lawyers. How do I both impress them with my data science knowledge but not overwhelm them with terminology they aren’t familiar with. I know what the goals of the data analysis is for the role, have some thoughts on data they could gather that they probably aren’t (I have found some reports they’ve released in the past), and have some ideas on how machine learning could be used to meet the end goal. I’m just concerned about translating that for non-data science people, especially the machine learning piece. 

I’d really just love any tips for interviewing for a data heavy role with non-data folks. How do you leave an impression without them thinking you are just making up things? 😂",Interview tips for the job I am so oddly qualified for it’s scaring,datascience

"Hello everyone, 

I saw yesterday that a data analyst job in what I consider to be my dream company was open. I couldn't believe it because this company doesn't usually hire in the city I'm in! Here comes my issue. I am a noob data analyst. I just finished my post-grad in econ after three grueling years, but due to some financial bumps, I've been working my ass off during that time to survive and did not start getting into any sort of statistical analysis language even though I knew I kinda had to in order to compete in the market, but working three jobs and pulling off a masters was really hard, and I only just finished it. I literally had just finished this [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/r-programming/?utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=udemyads&amp;utm_campaign=LongTail_la.EN_cc.ROW&amp;utm_content=deal4584&amp;utm_term=_._ag_77879424134_._ad_535397279649_._kw__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-1007766171312_._li_9043483_._pd__._&amp;matchtype=&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwoIqhBhAGEiwArXT7K5zDFkGOFssuVOMXWu8W6kiSVxA_kPg7rPua1LEBgKitmUqM79jmphoC_ZMQAvD_BwE) course on R (the reason I'm learning R and not Python is that the course was a gift from someone) when I saw the posting, and I plan on finishing the last part of the swirl package tonight.   


Some parts of the job requirement include: ""Experience in SQL and ability to work with large amounts of data. Data collection, data processing, data cleaning and analysis using essential python libraries (e.g. Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels etc.)."" I am still a noob in R. I got used to all the hotkeys and shortcuts and know the essential packages and their functions, and I also found it fun to use, but I'm pretty inexperienced obviously, so I'm doing small stuff right now to practice.

"Good morning everyone, I am doing a data science project, and I am looking for recommendations/tips that can help me to carry it out. 

The project is based on predicting monthly sales of a certain product. At the beginning of each month (around day 5-6), we are provided with an estimate of monthly sales. In addition, as the month progresses, more and more daily sales become visible, which allows us to better estimate the total monthly sales. The idea is to create a model that, for each day of the month based on the daily sales up to that day and the initial estimate, predicts the monthly sales value. Additionally, we also have information about the number of working days per month.

" Hi all,

I am a motivated and passionate 20-year-old who is interested in pursuing a career in data science. I completed a year of data engineering and received a cum laude (77%) grade, but I found the way my university taught frustrating. They taught for exams instead of pure learning, and it didn't prepare me for industry readiness. Additionally, I wasn't interested in the engineering aspect of data, so I realized that continuing with this degree wouldn't benefit me in the long run.

I have taken a year off to reevaluate my career goals and have developed a plan to enter the field of data science without a degree. My plan includes taking online courses from DataCamp and Coursera, building a community of people to work on projects, doing internships, and writing about data science on my blog (the Data Kid). I believe that this will equip me with the skills and experience I need to get a job in the field.

However, I am aware that the field of data science is highly competitive, and many employers prefer candidates with degrees. Therefore, I would appreciate any advice from experts in the field who may have gone through a similar journey or have experience hiring candidates without degrees.

A bit about myself, for the past 2 years, I've been teaching myself data science in order to get ahead. In this time, I've become really fluent in python, SQL, VBA, and general concepts such as ETL, wrangling...etc. I've also been able to use a lot of what I've learned in my current role. I'm by no means an expert, but I've been able to make some good progress at work with what I've done so far.

Back to the new role. I had a couple of interviews with my new boss and director, and started describing the ETL process I do for email data. They had never heard of ETL. Beyond that, someone from their team reached out to me later and asked if I could help them find the name for a database in MS SQL. When I asked what type of data they were looking for they sent me a screenshot of the table with db name attached. It seemed as if they didn't understand the difference between a db, server, or table.

"Hi, I am working on a project for my probability and statistics class and I am a bit confused on how to continue. I am analysing a dataset of all premier league games from the 2010/11 season to the 2019/20 season. What I am trying to do is analyse the conversion rate (goals scored per game/shots taken per game) and create a distribution. I am not sure if I should use a normal distribution or a binomial distribution as the conversion rate is technically a proportion of success divided by trials. So far this what I have tried but I am not sure if I am going about this correctly.

Firstly I tried using a normal distribution as when I divide the goals per game/shots taken per game I get continuous values, expect for some zeros which are the games where no goals were scored. However the data is not completely normal, so I artificially normalised by doing log(1+goals per game/shots taken per game). While it did not create a huge difference, the data is more normal now. Would I just create a normal distribution and find the mean and variance using the values given by the log transformation?

The other approach I took was using the binomial distribution as my population is large and it approximates the normal distribution. Firstly I used

E(x)=mu=nP

Var(x)=nP(1-P)

But I was not sure if this was correct because this would be a distribution of the number of successes, which is the goals scored. But that is not what I want to analyse, I want to analyse the conversion rate.

So instead I tried using the proportion random variable.

P=X/n (where X is the number of successes, goals scored)

mu=P

Var(x)=(P(1-P))/n

"Hi everyone! 

I'm considering an MS in data science, preferably an online, affordable, and fairly reputable program. My undergrad background is in applied math and statistics. I took Intro to Python and R in my freshman and junior years, respectively, but have not used them since, so I need to start from scratch. I had been working as a data analyst at a startup firm for 1.5 years (unfortunately got laid off recently). I gained valuable experience in the business domain (quantitative marketing) and, had a chance to use SQL and analytical tools like Tableau to solve real-world problems.

Since I'm job hunting right now, I have time on my hands. I would also like to keep my knowledge intact and upgrade my skills in data science. In the past, I have taken a data analytics BootCamp (a suggestion from someone at the time and based on the restrictions I faced from my student visa in pursuing MS and working at the same time); I didn't like it and regretted it, to be honest. I learned SQL but also useless tools like Microsoft SSRS and SSIS; thankfully, my supervisor advised me to study Tabluea as these are becoming obsolete. I have also tried taking courses on Udemy and Coursera in the past, but I cannot properly finish a course on time, and it's very hard for me to excel in self-paced programs. Also, you can retake the quizzes/assignments several times, which makes the whole process fairly easy compared to a real university class. 

I really enjoy university-style learning, but I have a limited budget, need to start soon, and cannot afford to pay \~50k and more. I would also like to start this summer and take classes at an accelerated rate. Even if an in-person MS program is my first choice, my situation brings me back to the self-paced online master's programs.  I have researched a few programs so far:  


* Eastern University MS in DS: affordable but not reputable, has mixed reviews
* Western Governors University Master’s in Data Analytics Degree: affordable but not reputable. Plus, it's data analytics, and I'm planning to focus more on DS.
* Georgia Tech Online Master of Science in Analytics: affordable, reputable, but the next start date is ambiguous (it currently says Spring 2024, which is too far for me)

Could anyone please give me your opinion on these programs or other programs based on your experience? I'd really appreciate it! I would like to start as soon as possible.",Seeking advice on MS programs in Data Science,datascience

We all have heard an uncountable amount of predictions about how AI will ***terk err jerbs!***

However, here we have a proper study on the topic from OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania. They investigate how Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) could automate tasks across different occupations \[1\].

Although I’m going to discuss how the study comes with a set of “imperfections”, the findings still make me really excited. The findings suggest that machine learning is going to deliver some serious productivity gains.

People in the data science world fought tooth and nail for years to squeeze some value out of incomplete data sets from scattered sources while hand-holding people on their way toward a data-driven organization. At the same time, the media was flooded with predictions of omniscient AI right around the corner.

*Let’s dive in and take an* exciting glimpse into the future of labor markets\*!\*

# What They Did

The study looks at all US occupations. It breaks them down into tasks and assesses the possible level of for each task. They use that to estimate how much automation is possible for a given occupation.

The researchers used the [O\*NET database,](https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html) which is an occupation database specifically for the U.S. market. It lists 1,016 occupations along with its standardized descriptions of tasks.

The researchers annotated each task once manually and once using GPT-4. Thereby, each task was labeled as either somewhat (&lt;50%) or significantly (&gt;50%) automatable through LLMs. In their judgment, they considered both the direct “exposure” of a task to GPT as well as to a secondary GPT-powered system, e.g. LLMs integrated with image generation systems.

To reiterate, a higher “exposure” means that an occupation is more likely to get automated.

Lastly, they enriched the occupation data with wages and demographic information. This was used to determine whether e. g. high or low-paying jobs are at higher risk to be automated.

So far so good. This all sounds pretty decent. Sure, there is a lot of qualitative judgment going into their data acquisition process. However, we gotta cut them some slag. These kinds of studies always struggle to get any hard data and so far they did a good job.

However, there are a few obvious things to criticize. But before we get to that let’s look at their results.

# Key Findings

The study finds that 80% of the US workforce, across all industries, could have at least some tasks affected. Even more significantly, 19% of occupations are expected to have at least half of their tasks significantly automated!

Furthermore, they find that higher levels of automation exposure are associated with:

* Programming and writing skills
* Higher wages (contrary to previous research!)
* Higher levels of education (Bachelor’s and up)

Lower levels of exposure are associated with:

* Science and critical thinking skills
* Manual work and tasks that might potentially be done using physical robots

This is somewhat unsurprising. We of course know that LLMs will likely not increase productivity in the plumbing business. However, their findings underline again how different this wave is. In the past, simple and repetitive tasks fell prey to automation.

*This time it’s the suits!*

If we took this study at face value, many of us could start thinking about life as full-time pensioners.

But not so fast! This, like all the other studies on the topic, has a number of flaws.

# Necessary Criticism

First, let’s address the elephant in the room!

OpenAI co-authored the study. They have a vested interest in the hype around AI, both for commercial and regulatory reasons. Even if the external researchers performed their work with the utmost thoroughness and integrity, which I am sure they did, the involvement of OpenAI could have introduced an unconscious bias.

*But there’s more!*

The occupation database contains over 1000 occupations broken down into tasks. Neither GPT-4 nor the human labelers can possibly have a complete understanding of all the tasks across all occupations. Hence, their judgment about how much a certain task can be automated has to be rather hand-wavy in many cases.

Flaws in the data also arise from the GPT-based labeling itself.

The internet is flooded with countless sensationalist articles about how AI will replace jobs. It is hard to gauge whether this actually causes GPT models to be more optimistic when it comes to their own impact on society. However, it is possible and should not be neglected.

The authors do also not really distinguish between labor-augmenting and labor-displacing effects and it is hard to know what “affected by” or “exposed to LLMs” actually means. Will people be replaced or will they just be able to do more?

Last but not least, lists of tasks most likely do not capture all requirements in a given occupation. For instance ""making someone feel cared for"" can be an essential part of a job but might be neglected in such a list.

# Take-Away And Implications

GPT models have the world in a frenzy - rightfully so.

Nobody knows whether 19% of knowledge work gets heavily automated or if it is only 10%.

As the dust settles, we will begin to see how the ecosystem develops and how productivity in different industries can be increased. Time will tell whether foundational LLMs, specialized smaller models, or vertical tools built on top of APIs will be having the biggest impact.

In any case, these technologies have the potential to create unimaginable value for the world. At the same time, change rarely happens without pain. I strongly believe in human ingenuity and our ability to adapt to change. All in all, the study - flaws aside - represents an honest attempt at gauging the future.

Efforts like this and their scrutiny are our best shot at navigating the future. Well, or we all get chased out of the city by pitchforks.

Jokes aside!

What an exciting time for science and humanity!

"I am aware that there are tons of career advice questions on this sub, and that they may have become a bit tedious. Nevertheless, I think this sub is full of experienced, intelligent people who may have faced similar situations, and my decision making process is at a point where new input is needed. Therefore, I humbly ask for your advice.

At 39 years old, I have a BS/MS in Physics, a PhD in theoretical physics (many-body physics / quantum chemistry) and a BS in Business Administration with some economics. Very good grades throughout, although only from standard mid tier German universities. 

Since my graduation I have been working in the German automotive industry, for over 8 years now, in some kind of data architect / data science role, but of the very basic kind. I use intermediate SQL and some pyspark in databricks, also a few tools of the Azure toolstack, as well as visualization (Tableau etc). No ML at all, although I am very interested in learning. I did use Fortran, SAS and some other niche stuff in my PhD, but forgot all of it. Was a long time ago. My knowledge was limited to ""let's stackoverflow how to do this"".

My main strength is translating business needs into data structures and processes, and I hired/built a small team of five over the years. The management aspect works very well, we are five buddies having fun, we have zero fluctuation, and our output is way beyond all the other colleagues in our organization. Since most of these other colleagues are ""business excel people"", they depend on me and I have a lot of privileges like 90% remote and having the say when I want to go on vacation. I also don't work too much, about 35-40h with half of the time being meetings.

The catch: the pay is below my potential (90k$ TC), with the high taxation and medium living cost of Germany. My company (and most others here) have very narrow salary bands and seniority is more important than qualifications, so a slacking off senior employee is earning more than me. Even the management level jobs are not paid much better. I am also not optimistic about where the industry is heading and about the German economy as a whole, so I'd prefer to get out.

I basically have three options:
1. Join the ranks of slacking off senior employees over the time, making my past achievements, qualifications and potential irrelevant. The low stress variant, which doesn't sit right with me though.
2. Self-teach DS to a certain degree and try to look for a tier 2 management job in the US which doesn't need hands-on experience in being an ""actual"" data scientist. I have yet to find an example of such a job, most require real experience in serious problems. Maybe it's just a question how well I am selling my work experience though.
3. Self-teach DS hardcore and ""start over"" as a non-management DS beginner. Given my age, I am not sure this would work, and it would not properly utilize the (soft) skills I have gained in my current line of work.

Maybe I am completely on the wrong track and another kind of role would be more suitable for me. I found that I am better with people and more inexperienced with programming than a Physics PhD might suggest, but I bring the analytical skills, efficiency and willingness to learn that usually comes with it.

Do you maybe have examples of jobs that would fit my profile? A low-medium stress role that is bridging the gap between business and analytics/data, possibly as a manager? What would you do in my situation?

Since then, I have continued in my job search because I would prefer to start working earlier and I also want to keep the door open to more opportunities given the way things are in the market right now. I have applied to over 400 roles by using LinkedIn, my university career center's website, Glassdoor and just generally googling different companies and applying on their website. Aside from my offer, I only got one interview, which was just for a financial analyst role and nothing related to DS/DE which is what I want to do. I am starting to get very anxious about what I am doing wrong, but I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. I've received feedback on my resume from people in the workforce and I edited it thanks to VMock as well. I am not sure what else to do. I know already I won't have the most competitive edge given ""entry level"" DS/DE don't exactly exist but of course, I need some way to break into the industry given I only have my M.S. in this field, but don't have real world professional experience in DS &amp; DE.

"The question: Have doctors fled Twitter since Elon Musk became CEO?

Here's what I did to try to answer this problem.

* Visualized my data:
   * I made a line chart of Twitter weekly activity by doctors in our panel from 2010 to now. 
   * The graph shows that they increased activity on Twitter from 2010-2016, then started decreasing activity from 2017-present. I don't know why. 
   * Activity looks like it drops off on Thanksgiving and Christmas, and during the summer.
* Tried to model the 2017-present decline using OLS from python's [statsmodels package](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.regression.linear_model.OLS.html):
   * I have dummy variables for each year in the dataset. The coefs are negative (p&lt;0.001).
   * Dummy variables for the weeks of Thanksgiving and Christmas. Coefs are negative (p&lt;0.001).
   * Dummy variable for the summer months (1 if month = \[6,7,8\] else 0). Coef is negative (p&lt;0.001).
   * A dummy variable for `elon_ceo` which is active after Oct 27, 2022. Coef is negative (p&lt;0.001).

It fits very well. Adjusted r-squared is 0.92. 

However, I really don't think I can conclude that Elon's reign has actually reduced Twitter activity for the people in our panel. Sure, activity is declining and the decline was a little bit more pronounced this year, but that's happened before. The percent change YoY for each of the weeks of 2023, for example, is certainly higher than previous years but it's not really extreme.

"Hey all. I am looking for some advice on getting a masters. 

My undergrad was in philosophy with a math minor. I took an online boot camp during lockdown, I worked freelance for awhile, and now have been in an analyst position for the past year. 

I am debating between pursuing a masters in statistics or data science and I would love to hear what you’re experience are with both. 

As I see it, I am more interested in statistics but I don’t know that I need more stats training. I stay up to date on common stats and work in business analytics and, practically speaking, don’t deal with more than histograms and normalization. I don’t see myself leaving a business analytics role and while I am certainly not a stats expert, I know it well enough to be a respected resource in my role. 

I am also considering a data science master but I am not sure that it would be much more than applied statistics and some technical training. My technical skills are strong enough that I don’t need to develop them much further (I work regularly in SQL, Python, and BI) unless I wanted to expand into more data pipelining. (Which, frankly, I don’t. My soft skills are strong enough that my company relies on me to communicate the more difficult concepts to clients and I plan to leverage my communication skills as my largest asset for my future career)

While I do believe furthering my education is always a good investment ( and something I would enjoy) I am struggling to see they payoff for either of these options outweighing the cost.

bayesian regression, with priors set to be equal to the original model coefs  ( think this will be too slow on large datasets though)

This week’s story sounds like it was taken straight from a science fiction novel.

The leaders of the Church are shaking in fear because of what AI could bring to light.

Thousands of years ago, a massive volcanic eruption wiped out a monumental city in a matter of hours. Among the thousands of destroyed houses was one very special estate. It belonged to a close relative of the most powerful Kaiser that ever lived.

On his estate was a vast library filled with thousands of papyrus scrolls of unspeakable value.

The scrolls contain texts from long-lost secrets about philosophy, science, and possibly even about the origins of modern religions. When the house was destroyed along with the library, the conditions under the scorching hot lava miraculously preserved the scrolls. Under the stone, the scrolls survived for thousand of years.

The scrolls were discovered but have become so fragile that they cannot be opened anymore without destroying them. So, scientists are using modern particle accelerators and AI to unlock the secrets hidden in them. A price of $1M will go to whoever manages to read the scrolls first.

*Pretty good no?*

The best part about this story is that it is not made up. Okay, I might have been adding some drama in my depiction of church leaders shaking under their cassocks. I am pretty sure they neither know what is going on nor are they reading this newsletter.

In this week's edition, we will look at a spine-tingling story behind the [Vesuvius Challenge](https://scrollprize.org/) and see how computer vision can help to unlock the secrets of the past.

Let’s jump in!

**What Actually Happened**

In 79 AD the Vesuvius volcano erupted and buried the city of Pompeii. What very few people know is that multiple cities were also destroyed in the incident. One of these cities was Herculaneum.

We can think of Herculaneum as the Beverly Hills of Pompeii.

The city was full of marvelous villas and estates. One of the more impressive ones belonged to Caesar’s father-in-law. It goes without saying, the guy was very powerful, well-connected, and super-rich.

[Example img\_name](https://preview.redd.it/3nqjl5y984ta1.png?width=422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6f987590c03ca582d1af828c01eee2277c7f2d50)

Estate of Caesar’s father-in-law

Inside his estate was a giant library full of scrolls from the Greek and Roman times.

When the villa was destroyed, the heat of the lava carbonized (turning to charcoal without burning) the scrolls. This has preserved them for almost 2000 years. Since the 18th century, different groups tried to dig up the scrolls.

To date, more than 1800 scrolls have been excavated and most-likely there are many more under ground.

Some people speculate that his library might even contain scrolls from the library of Alexandria that burned down a few years before. From these scrolls, we might discover completely new philosophical schools, scientific secrets of the Greeks, and *heck!* maybe drafts of the bible with GPT watermarks on them.

However, there is a catch!find

Quite frankly, the scrolls have more resemblance with a cigarette bud than a roll of papyrus.

[Example img\_name](https://preview.redd.it/77ir7zz984ta1.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=91f3bbd6283d73bb64c366358aa2732a85363a0b)

Herculaneum Scroll

Looking at the image above, it is needless to say that simply unrolling them is not really an option.

In the 17 hundreds, an Italian monk painstakingly tried to unroll some of the scrolls over several decades. The result was mostly papyrus confetti. He managed to uncover a few intact fragments that had philosophical texts written in Greek on them.

This is obviously not scalable and would destroy most of the texts. However, if we could read the scrolls this would more than double the amount of text that was handed down to us from the Greek and Roman times. The value of that is obviously hard to overstate!

*But, if we cannot unroll the scrolls, how are we supposed to find what’s written on them?*

**How To Read The Scrolls Without Opening Them**

The Herculaneum scrolls are not the first carbonized scrolls to be found.

In 1970, a number of 2000-year-old scrolls were discovered in the En-Gedi Oasis close to the Dead Sea. With no Italian monks at hand and the foresight that opening the scrolls would destroy them Dr. Seals from the University of Kentucky pioneered a method called *virtual unwrapping.*

It allows us to read the scrolls without opening them.

First, a high-resolution CT scan is created of each scroll. The scan creates digital slices from the scroll. The slices are created lengthwise, similar to how a cucumber is cut. Now, in order to perform the virtual unwrapping a sheet of the scroll is traced along the cross-sections.

[Example img\_name](https://preview.redd.it/3fdm424a84ta1.png?width=945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1ade404ada1a841d024f1eb41d7697b6519d548e)

In the image above, you can see an animation of how this is done cross-section by cross-section until a connected piece of the scroll is extracted. These connected pieces are then virtually flattened in order to read the text (see video below).

*So far so good. Why can we not just do the same with the Scrolls from Herculaneum?*

There are a few challenges with applying this technique to the Herculaneum scrolls. On the one hand, the scrolls are very tightly wrapped and generally in pretty bad shape. On the other hand, the ink in the Herculaneum scrolls is radiolucent. This means that X-rays pass through the ink the same way they pass through the papyrus.

As a result, the ink, in the CT scans, is not visible to the human eye.

But there is good news. It has been shown that neural networks can pick up on subtle patterns in the scans that are created by the ink \[2\]. Next, we will look at how neural networks are being trained on the scans and how to win the price. *Read on!*

**The Challenge of Training On The Fragments**

As mentioned above, a few of the scrolls were unrolled by an exceptionally patient Italian monk.

[Example img\_name](https://preview.redd.it/27vy1n5a84ta1.png?width=485&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=37836b061b12b31f95bbc32134c662aa1f82fb25)

Scroll Fragments With Ink

Some of the resulting fragments have legible ink on them.

So, people created training datasets from them. First, a 4µm 3D X-ray scan was created for the fragments. Second, an additional infrared image was taken of the scroll fragments to make the ink more visible. Then, the ink on ht IR images was hand-labeled. The labeled images are then aligned with the scans in order to create input and label pairs.

Next, the areas with ink were hand-labeled. Finally, the labeled images were aligned with the scans in order to create input and label pairs.

[Example img\_name](https://preview.redd.it/rki6yy7a84ta1.png?width=910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1afb9f0f210b2c35cf01a5f4dbcc7cf4b9ac3f6c)

Overview Of Data Acquisition Process For Scroll Fragments

The [data paper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/educelab/EduceLab-Scrolls/main/paper/EduceLab-Scrolls.pdf), in which they trained a model on the fragments, reports a pretty low recall (in the 40% range).

However, their approach appears to be quite basic. They formulated the problem as a patch-wise binary classification. So, for each patch, their model predicted ink vs. no ink. Furthermore, the final accuracy might not need to be very high to make the text readable.

Most likely, translating the model to the full scrolls will be a tough nut to crack.

[Example img\_name](https://preview.redd.it/9m6pbfaa84ta1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a4efcfee9ec94ef5aa76e86c4489eedfed8cf473)

The Two Scrolls To Be Read

Alongside the fragment datasets, we are provided with 8µm 3D X-ray scans of two full scrolls. As a matter of fact, we are only given half of the scan data for each of the two scrolls. The other half is held out as a validation set. Each half-scroll scan consists of 14,000 .tif files with 120MB each. Since each slice is 8µm tall, the scroll half is 11.2cm tall.

The two scrolls need to be virtually unwrapped first.

The software to do the unwrapping is provided. Some manual work is required to get it going, but all the pieces are there. I dearly hope that the challenge attracts many brilliant minds from all over the world!

If you have some time on your hand, or you simply want to make some money to buy a few A100 GPUs go and [check out the challenge](https://scrollprize.org/)!

The best ink detection model gets $100K and whoever is the first to read four separate passages on one of the full scrolls wins $700K. An additional $200K of prices will be announced in the coming months.

Money aside, the thought that some guy or girl with a cup of coffee and a laptop could create a model which unlocks this trove of wisdom makes me excited about the present and the future alike.

What an exciting time for science and humanity!

This week’s story sounds like it was taken straight from a science fiction novel.

The leaders of the Church are shaking in fear because of what AI could bring to light.

Thousands of years ago, a massive volcanic eruption wiped out a monumental city in a matter of hours. Among the thousands of destroyed houses was one very special estate. It belonged to a close relative of the most powerful Kaiser that ever lived.

On his estate was a vast library filled with thousands of papyrus scrolls of unspeakable value.

The scrolls contain texts from long-lost secrets about philosophy, science, and possibly even about the origins of modern religions. When the house was destroyed along with the library, the conditions under the scorching hot lava miraculously preserved the scrolls. Under the stone, the scrolls survived for thousand of years.

The scrolls were discovered but have become so fragile that they cannot be opened anymore without destroying them. So, scientists are using modern particle accelerators and AI to unlock the secrets hidden in them. A price of $1M will go to whoever manages to read the scrolls first.

*Pretty good no?*

The best part about this story is that it is not made up. Okay, I might have been adding some drama in my depiction of church leaders shaking under their cassocks. I am pretty sure they neither know what is going on nor are they reading this newsletter.

In this week's edition, we will look at a spine-tingling story behind the [Vesuvius Challenge](https://scrollprize.org/) and see how computer vision can help to unlock the secrets of the past.

Let’s jump in!

**What Actually Happened**

In 79 AD the Vesuvius volcano erupted and buried the city of Pompeii. What very few people know is that multiple cities were also destroyed in the incident. One of these cities was Herculaneum.

We can think of Herculaneum as the Beverly Hills of Pompeii.

The city was full of marvelous villas and estates. One of the more impressive ones belonged to Caesar’s father-in-law. It goes without saying, the guy was very powerful, well-connected, and super-rich.

Now they're like X years in NLP, or X years in CV, or X years with this specific model. I'm noticing different industries have different needs/skills, so even though I meet most of the requirements they're asking for X years in some technique I've never used.

"**TL:DR: I have a background in DS, but even as a 'Data Scientist', I do 100% DE work. Would like to move closer to DS. Don't hate my job, but losing patience. Feel like I've trapped myself and lost touch with my DS skillset. Considering building portfolio via Kaggle or similar, while job searching. Need advice on how to transition back.**  


Hey all, need some advice.  I'm early into my career, but I'm trying to figure out how to go forward from here.  A little bit of background. I have a BS &amp; MS in essentially information/computer science (not quite as theory/math heavy as CS, more application focused, but I digress), with emphasis in machine learning/AI for business problems. Basically, my knowledge might be more in line with advanced analytics (applying  existing models to new business domains) vs 'data science' (researching/making novel models), although I'm open and willing to be in the math heavy research side if the opportunity presents itself.   


My first work experience was as a data science intern on an internal consulting team were I was helping to build models and solve problems using data from various other teams in the business (where I was hoping to be with my current job). I was there for a year before leaving to try something on the business side of things (big mistake, hated that).  This is the type of work I enjoy doing the most.  


Fast forward a couple internships and I'm at my current job. I've been here for a couple years now (first full time position) as a 'data scientist'. I was here originally as an intern but converted. The original intention of the team, and my role, was to do data science/ML work in the traditional sense. Unfortunately, me and the other data scientists don't do DS work. My role has essentially transformed into a data engineering role, where I handle ETL pipelines for the reports that the BI folks on the team do. This isn't to say that I don't find value in my work and I do use related skills, like SQL. I don't hate it. But, it's frustrating that the one ML project proposal we've come up with keeps getting pushed back.. The 'promise' that was made a couple years ago just isn't happening, and it's impacting my motivation a lot. I think its time to move on.  


But here's my problem. I'm worried that my skillset has moved away from the type of work I want to be doing. I worry that I've locked myself into a data engineering career. This wouldn't be a bad thing if  I was an engineer working directly with ML pipelines. Then I would at least have some exposure. Even though my title and job description *is* that of a 'traditional' data scientist, I have no recent projects to speak on.  My resume isn't as impressive it should be for a data scientist 4 years into their career (counting internships).   


What should I do? I'm scared that the transition back to more explicit DS work will come with a pay cut (going from mid-level position back to entry-level), because  I have no recent projects. My core skills (Python, R, etc.) are weaker than they should be from not using them as much. My initial plan is to retouch on those skills and poke around on Kaggle, even the toy datasets, to show something. Otherwise, I've considered trying to get an IBM or Google DS certificate, but this feels like a waste considering I have a master's degree and grad certification in ML/AI.

I also have more projects under my belt (I recently finalized a machine learning project where I implemented a basic binary class. neural network), but I am unsure if that would truly stand out and help.

The mean or median alone doesn't really tell us anything, because the data is so long tailed.

What metric can I use that will show if we are improving? I thought the mode and the interquartile range could work. A decrease in the mode would show that we are decreasing the hump of the tail, and a decrease in the IQR would show that the spread is also decreasing.

🔥 We’re thrilled to introduce BastionLab, our simple privacy framework for data science collaboration! To see what remote data exploration looks like when all privacy concerns are automatically handled for you, you can check [our GitHub](https://github.com/mithril-security/bastionlab/) or directly go to our [Quick Tour](https://bastionlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/quick-tour/quick-tour/) tutorial, which is also available on [Colab ](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mithril-security/bastionlab/blob/v0.3.5/docs/docs/quick-tour/quick-tour.ipynb)🔒

# Built for sensitive data collaboration

Collaboration between data owners and data scientists is a big challenge for highly regulated fields like health, finance, or advertising due to security and privacy issues. When collaborating remotely, data owners have to open their whole dataset, often through a Jupyter notebook. This too-broad access creates huge privacy gaps because too many operations are allowed, which enables data scientists to extract information from the remote infrastructure (print the whole database, save the dataset in the weights, etc). 

⚙️ BastionLab solves this problem by providing fine-grained access control. It guarantees data owners that data scientists can only perform privacy-friendly operations on their data and that only anonymized outputs are shared with them.

# How does BastionLab work?

BastionLab makes sure that the data owner’s remote data is never accessed directly by the data scientist. Three main elements ensure this: 

* First, a ‘safe zone’ is defined by the data owner to filter the data scientist’s queries, which enforces control while allowing for interactivity. 
* Second, expressivity is limited. This means that the type of operations that can be executed by the data scientists is restricted to avoid arbitrary code execution. 
* Finally, the data scientist never accesses the dataset locally. They only manipulate a local object that contains metadata to interact with the remotely hosted dataset - and data owners can always see the calls made by that object. 

# Ready to try?

"It's brutal. When I have used ImportXML the first time, it looked like a miracle! I can retrieve data from external website *AND extract data from HTML in one function call*, wow! Now I am sick of it.

**Custom processing and conversions of data is painful in Google Sheets.** Let's say you want to import just 32.22 number from ""cost: 32.22 USD"" string extracted from some website. It is possible to do it in Google Sheets, with some fiddling around formulas and scratching your head, but obviously it is much easier to accomplish this task Javascript or Python, especially if you have lots and lots of data to cleanup!

**There is no proper launch and cache control in ImportXML.** There is no ""scrape now"" button in your Google Sheet. You can't control how often the ImportXML is triggered (well, unless you are a huge fan of Goole Apps Script!) and if you have many cells populated with importXML, it is very easy to occasionally trigger an avalanche of external http calls when opening and editing your sheet. There are also no caching mechanisms in Google Sheets, so if the last call to ImportXML fails, the cell will get *ERR!* value.

**ImportXML only works with basic websites** (no SPAs rendered in browsers can be scraped this way, any basic web scraping protection or connectivity issue breaks the process, no control over HTTP request geo location, or number of retries)

ImportXML just fails to extract data from a huge amount of websites for me.

I have finally found an alternative solution which I have been using for some time, it's more complicated to start but is just infinitely flexible and it just.. works for web scraping. My recipe consists of two ingredients:

1. Proper automation framework: I choose [Make.com](https://make.com/) because it is essentially a cheaper and more techy Zapier competitor, it is mature, and it works great. Free plan.
2. Web scraping API: I use [ScrapeNinja.net](https://scrapeninja.net/) because it allows to write custom Javascript extractors which allow me to extract any data from infinitely complex HTML of the target website, and convert it into arbitrary JSON structure for later usage. It has free plan. **And it can render SPAs like a real browser.**

"Hi everyone!

So I have 8 separate spreadsheets, filled up with stock market trading data (backtesting),  and I'm stuck in professionally filtering and comparing the outcomes.  
E.g. in 1 spreadsheet there are data from \~700 trades that have taken place, with 6 diffent criteria noted down for each of them (including date, time, size of the market move etc.) To each of the trades, there are several outcomes percentage wise. (e.g. if it reaches a pre-defined level, I close the trade or if it reaches 1:2 risk reward ratio I close the trade etc.)

I would like to evaulate this data the best way possible. I'd like to see that how each result column depends on each of the criterias.  Basically, I want to compare the % of return based on a lot of existing data to see what aspect can definitely, statistically, produce a profit. 

 E.g. ""some criteria"" if &gt;=x then its 80% going to have a losing result. Alternatively, if &lt;=y then it will have a 60% positive result. 

 TL,DR: I would like to examine how the profitability of trading positions statistically depends on e.g. the size of the marke move, and so on, with 6 different criteria like this. And if this has been calculated, I’d need a summary of them altogether to see, that how each individually calculated and optimized parameter would fit with each other. This would provide me the final product, the best possible outcome from this data.

I tried to evaulate by trial and error, by just filtering them in Excel, then I got into pivot tables, which simplified it a bit, but still a huge amount of work, and just too much possiblities.   
Do you guys have any recommendations in terms of evaulating, or what software to use for this? Maybe Tableau could be better in visualizing the data statisctically, then cutting out the losing trades that way? Any recommendations on how to optimize, and compare the results?

"I recently started working on a time series prediction and forecasting task, and the dataset that I use contains close to 700 features and only 4 years worth of monthly data points (just 48 samples). Part of my preprocessing workflow will obviously be to remove the multicollinearity. As a first starting point, I considered using the VIF before going onto other methods. After the first tests, I quickly realized that almost all of the features are flagged as highly correlated. I went on to further test this hypothesis by running correlation tests on individual features that got the highest VIF values, and found out that they were not linearly correlated to more than a couple of features.

This outcome led me to the question of whether VIF is dependent on sample size, and if the results would be different with a much larger sample size.

I've posted about learning SQL a few times this past week and I've gotten several responses saying essentially that SQL is nothing more than reading in data from a database and doing simple manipulations on it, like ``select`` and ``merge``, but also several other responses saying to be sure I learn more SQL than that if I want to actually have useful skills.  Obviously context is key and I figure there are some people who only use SQL for the basics and others who use it for mich more advanced stuff.  

I guess what I'm asking is, how do I know when SQL is the appropriate tool for the job?  Like, is it a good tool to use for exploratory analysis, such as computing descriptive statistics and creating summary tables of variables?  Or is mostly used to extract/group/etc subsets of data?  Or, to put it another way, should I use SQL just for the same types of operations I'd use R's dplyr library for, when working on a small dataset read in from an Excel file, then switch to R or Python?  Or would it be reasonable to also use it for EDA?","As a newbie to SQL, how do I decide whether to use SQL for the actual data analysis in a project, or just for wrangling the data?",datascience

"Hi everyone!

I psuedo joined the tech layoff getting put into a free agency to apply anywhere by my company and have been joining the mad job rush getting into things. I thought to share some experiential learning I had going on that roughly equates to normal good practice, but is also a good reminder to always consider ourselves expendable and a free agent regardless of if we're safe or not. I'm getting this quality checked on multiple communities and I'd love to hear your feedback.

1. If your resume stands out, they have a specific need, and you fill it beautifully which you’ll understand based on the job description, you can expect to get through the hiring process quickly.
2. If it’s a not sure, the initial contact and scheduling of the interview will go quickly and the process can be very robust based on the size of the company. Even a small company coming from big names can be concerned about the people brought in.
3. The more towards early venture capital you are, the harder and more specific you can expect the hiring process to be because you’ll need to have a very specific skillset to help bootstrap the employer. If it is something bigger like FAANG, they’ll be more inclusive of different backgrounds and start off on the easier foot with something that would represent a leetcode question .
4. Whoever it is though, they will hug to their process, so just give them the room they need to feel they’re making the right decision as they will do the same for you. Keep applying in the meantime.
5. Move towards the companies/positions that are incredibly fascinated with you as that’s the level you’re probably at for the moment.
6. Understand which interviews you enjoyed the most and prioritize learning in that direction throughout the year as that’s where the next step of your career probably is.
7. See what you could chain into next based on the positions you get and relative volume of demand in the market using job boards like LinkedIn as you start to get a feel for how in demand that job role is.
8. Get a feel too for how this current position prepares you for your next position. Maybe it lets you consolidate 3 resumes down to 1 for instance and be very specific on the skills you prep throughout the year in wait for the new role.
9. At a certain point in the search, you’ll start to notice some leads are consistently souring. Use that understanding to get a sense of how competitive the market is, but also what skills you lack so that you can grab an appropriate position to be successful in the future.
10. Have fun with the process. It can be overall nailbiting a lot of the time, but everyone is working to everyone’s elses’ success. Keep up the momentum, but give each other room!
11. As the leads start to wind down, feel free to get started closing the gap towards the next role. The quicker you grow, the faster they grow and the quicker the project will be done. Things might get a bit rambunctious, but focus on getting to the finish line and adding the completed tasks to a brag doc.
12. You can have all the education in the world on a specific topic and the recruiters will still turn you down for unknown reasons once talking with a hiring manager. Once you get good, partner up with people in teams and push your skills to the next level, thereby alleviating any concerns had on their end.

"For context, I'm currently finishing my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and I just completed my minor in data science (i.e. I finished the last course required to satisfy the minor's requirements).  I found I like the data science stuff significantly more than EE, but I'm too far along to even consider switching majors at this point.  Hence, I'm trying to self-teach additional data science skills and I know being to use SQL and work with databases (something none of my DS courses covered unfortunately) in particular is a vital skill to have if I have any hope of getting a job in DS. 

I posted previously about this and I got a ton of responses with people recommending so many different learning platforms and several different API's and DBMS's that I'm a little unsure where to start.  I started just reading about what databases even _are_ so I can have a clear mental model in my head, but now I'm struggling to decide how to actually get started with SQL itself.  

The easiest thing (and hence what I'm tempted to do) would probably be to use one of the Python API's people recommended, just because I already have some experience using Python for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis, and I have Python fully set-up on my system already (and getting everything set up to use _any_ new programming language is typically a pain).  But is that a good idea, seeing as this will be the first time I've used SQL?  Will it it hurt me later on if I get used to just using Python to call SQL rather than learning how to use it directly?  Like, would prospective employers be less likely to higher me if I only have experience using SQL via Python, or will there be things I can't do through the API?  Or am I just completely overthinking this and it doesn't really matter whether I use SQL directly or indirectly?","I'm attempting to self-teach SQL.

Since I'll likely use the insight of the PCA to inform the feature engineering, I think a holdout data set is necessary - at least in theory. However, since anomalies are both \_anomalous\_ and sparse, I'm not really sure whether this can actually be practically implemented.

"I’m 27 - through my 20s I’ve had some industry changes, education pivots etc - but I finally found a bit of a niche in data science, if you consider data viz a vertical. 

I was hired as a data viz specialist this summer - finally fully getting away from my biz management background. I’m also a CS grad student (on and off), which also contributes to imposter syndrome (I struggle a bit). Anyways, in many ways, I’m still sort of entry level. 

I work in an agile environment with 3-4 data engineers, my boss is an ex sr analyst/engineer, and some salesforce folks. I just feel…stupid. They make these amazing things with data happen in queries, I just make it pretty dashboards and do some side admin work (notifications/comms). I get good feedback, I think I’m liked, and I’m the only data viz person remaining - I was an internal hire and we’ve tried 3 consultants to assist with data viz but were all canned for poor performance. So in a way, I am finding some stride in that I’m *the* person creating part of the experience for the end user. 

But then sometimes I feel capped. I’m not in SQL a lot. I have experience in Data Viz tools (Tableau, Power BI), but am mostly using a Salesforce equivalent. I do some light pseudo-SAQL coding (which I’m not sure is even great) but that’s it. I mean, a lot of my queries are sort of trial and error to get the desired output. It works, I’m not always fully sure why, I’m sure there’s a way to do what I did in 5 less lines. But I don’t know. I also manage the downstream dataflows, but that’s mostly simple joins and reporting to DE when a job fails. 

In some ways I’m learning…I think. But in others, I’m wondering if there’s growth in data viz. I love it. But it feels like I’m taking all the true work of the smart people and just doing the work they don’t have bandwidth too. Kind of like a designer and not a core data person. I could be wrong. Most of the time my boss has most of the ideas and I use them. I go back to other dashboards and tweak what worked there and move it to mine. I just feel dumb.

And then, what prompted this, is when I worked with the DE team the last few weeks. My only “data viz” equivalent is another consultant with like, 20 years experience, but he hates data viz and mostly hides in Salesforce tools and data management work. But even then, he knows a lot. We sync with data engineering on topics like data masking, AWS keys, object creation, schemas in tables…I’m just so lost. It’s above me. Sometimes I try to absorb as much as I can, others I just need not to learn something and overwhelm myself because I’m at peak capacity myself. 

But we talk, they solve it. I didn’t even fully understand what buckets are in AWS - dev, prod, etc. I feel like I’m quiet in meetings and let the smart people talk it out. Because I’m out of SQL, I feel like that skill isn’t as sharp. And we’re hiring another core analyst, so my focus remains on viz. and don’t get me wrong - I love viz. I think it’s sort of my niche - but I do want opportunity to do more, earn more, and more so contribute to my team and be useful. Right now it just feels like I’m running alongside everyone trying to keep up, but not fully “getting” these concepts of data work we’re doing. And obviously I don’t want to ask and sound stupid during meetings. And my boss has limited bandwidth and can’t just teach me things with all this time he doesn’t have. Even I. SQL, I do have the database but have no idea what to do with it. I was told to look into ROW_NUMBER, NOLOCK, etc - but still feel dumbfounded by simple concepts. 

This is mostly a vent. I just feel like a kinda not smart person benefitting from the work of great people, and being unable to understand these concepts. Yes I’m new in a way, but I want to do more and help more.

"Hi,

First off, I am not here to downplay the effectiveness of resumes.

When you are looking for a good job, it helps to have a resume that helps you stand out from the competition. In fact, here is a [good Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z90g0x/i_am_an_experienced_resume_writer_and_editor_and/) around using resumes to stand out from your competiton here.

When used correctly, you can use **BOTH your Linkedin profile and your standout resume** to get the tech job that you want.

Much like your resume, your goal is to **create a great first impression** so that you can get the right tech job that you want.

**WHY HAVE an OPTIMIZED LINKEDIN PROFILE ANYWAY?**

* **Linkedin has consistently 1.6 billion in monthly visitor traffic.** (that is a lot of people who are actively searching for business and professional connections. This means that you have a lot of people that you can reach out for the right tech job.)
* **Linkedin has 810 registered global members** (In a global job marketplace where remote working is a growing mainstay trend, your job employment options are wider with more managers reporting higher productivity levels among remote workers.)
* **According to** [**Linkedin**](https://news.linkedin.com/about-us#Statistics)**, 49 million use the platform to search for jobs** (This means with an optimized Linkedin profile, you can stand out from your growing competition - especially if you plan to work remotely in the first place.)

**What I am here to discuss here is how you can:**

1. optimize your Linkedin profile to generate active conversations
2. use your optimized Linkedin profile to generate more Connections with your Linkedin profile.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here are a few things that you need to keep in mind when:**

**OPTIMIZING YOUR LINKEDIN PROFILE:**

* **Create a strong Linkedin facial picture** (Use a very identifable facial picture where people can clearly see your picture. Smile, by the way. Your facial picture should be showing how you look like as a person.)
* **Create a clear banner picture** (You are missing out on a large opportunity to drive traffic to your Linkedin profile. Your Linkedin banner picture is one of the first thing that your potential employers or recruiters will see/present to your prosepective employers. Use your Linkedin banner picture to showcase specifically how you can be of a service. You can also use your banner picture to have more people message you by placing a call-to-action (""CTA"") so that people immediately know how to reach you.)
* **Know who your Linkedin profile is for.** (One reason that it takes longer to get the tech job that you want is because your Linkedin profile is usually broad and is treated like a record. With enough research, you can effectively target the right individual and tailor your Linkedin profile to that ""Persona"". This way, you can clearly communicate how you are of service to your potential employers.)
* **Keep all information relevant when it comes to appealing to right end viewer** (You don't need to list EVERYTHING but instead you can list relevant information that your end viewer wants to know. Today, within a hybrid/remote work environment, most employers are shifting their employees to focus on more higher-value work. Tailor your information to clearly address the proposed higher-value responsibilities that your employer is looking for. You can even create new information that tailors to the concerns that your potential employers has when it comes to hiring you directly.)
* **Organize your Linkedin profile around generating conversions** (This is key but the main point is that you use your Linkedin profile to generate more Connections - which in turn generates more conversions. Conversions are people resp)
* **Create external/native media that showcases your expertise** (People are lazy: you can exploit that from your competition. Experiment with Polls - so your content spreads to ""new"" Connections. Use short-form video with an in-video call-to-actions (share this video). When your potential employers see your video on your Linkedin profile, you can stand apart from your competition.)

&amp;#x200B;

*and* **GROWING YOUR LINKEDIN CONNECTIONS:**

* **Focus on generating conversations that transcend off on Linkedin** (While Linkedin is a great place for you to meet people, you want to move as many as those relationships to direct e-mail. Think of Linkedin as the public meeting place but the direct e-mail is the place that you can use to connect more intimately with your professional. This way, your messages are not absorbed into a sea of other messages. Plus, you have a direct relationship with your potential employer.)
* **Build an internal CRM** (There are tools that you can use to track your list of CRM. If money is tight, use AirTable to create a kanban board around a sales process so you can actively track where each employer is at when it comes to hiring you directly. With a CRM, you can actively prioritze which potential employer that you want to put more focus upon versus others. This also hastens the time between jobs or even finding a better fulfilling tech job overall.)
* **Actively reach out to your List of Connections** (You have Linkedin Connections. You should use them...not like a sociopath. However, you need to be starting Active Conversations. It may take a week or two to get a response but you need to build a habit of reaching out to your Connections (and new Connections) on a daily basis so that you always have fresh opportunities that you can always take advantage.)
* **Linkedin Sales Navigator is your best friend** (You can use Linkedin Sales Navigator to target the most active accounts on Linkedin. This hastens the response times that you will receive from potential Linkedin profiles. Plus, you have a rosterof new leads that you can use to generate new leads.)
* **Always grow your Linkedin Connections** (Shit happens. Always grow your Linkedin Connections so that way, you can always have opportunities on standby. Keep posting media that showcases your expertise. This way, you can grow your Linkedin Connections and have a rainy jar when your job ""unexpectedly"" goes sour: *a manager asks you to work in the office when you are super-productive in your own home*.)

"This is the question which is among roughly 20 others to be graded for a second interview. 

**2.** **In order to increase close rate, you instruct sales reps that, after each meeting, they should either (a) have a next-meeting scheduled or (b) call accounts every day.** **You** **decide** **to** **build** **a** **report** **to** **measure** **if** **reps** **are** **doing** **that.** **Mock** **up** **what the report should look like.** **You can use fake data.** 

 I have completed all the other questions besides this one because for one, I don't think the correlation of calling every day would net a positive result like the question insinuates and two, I don't think it's enough information in the first place to make a meaningful report.  Finally, I only have access to excel to make a report and I am not quite sure how I would use these few data points to reflect an impact on the closing percentage.  Am I missing something?

" I have tabular data where each group of 100 rows represents a deployment of a specific geometry that has certain features measured. For example, I have 10000 deployments stored in a column called ""Dep,"" which ranges from 1 to 1000. When fitting this data to an xgboost model, the model may mistakenly assume that the deployment numbers have an ordering relationship (e.g., that deployment 1 is less than deployment 2, which is less than deployment 3, and so on). However, this is not the case because all deployments are independent of each other. On the other hand, if I remove the ""Dep"" column, the model will not be able to differentiate between the different deployment groups and their unique geometries.

I got the idea of one hot encoding of the column dep, but it's useless as the training dataset has 7000 deployments while the test dataset has 3000. If I do a one hot encoding, the shapes will not match (along with a slew of other issues). Better think of another approach.

"I’m adapting one of my old algorithms where adds features based on some weight vector and then recalculates a score to see if adding the new feature helps.  

I’m testing it on the iris dataset with 996 noise features and noticed that sometimes it adds around 50-90 noise features because it increases the accuracy.  Less features is more in this case so I’m wondering if there is any penalty I can add that is on the same scale as the scoring metric (eg accuracy for classification which ranges from [0,1] or negative mean squared error which goes from (-inf,0]) but based on the number of features.  Basically saying “is it really worth it to add this feature?”

I know there’s L1 and L2 penalty for linear models but I don’t think that applies here because if o square the number of features or something it will be largely out of scale with the scoring metric (eg adding a feature has a positive change in accuracy of 0.3 so let’s keep it, another feature only adds to the accuracy by 0.001 so let’s not add it).

"For context, I posted last night asking whether it's worth learning SQL if I'm only doing DS as a hobby, and a lot of people said there's more I can do if I know SQL.  So I'm willing to give it a try, but I don't really know where to start.  I mean, there are plenty of tutorials available online, but I learn best from doing an actual project and looking stuff up as I go (I'm not interested in doing a course on Udemy or the like because I hate learning from recorded lectures -- especially since I'm doing this for fun, because I like data science, I don't want to force myself to watch a bunch of lectures).  So I was thinking I'd find an actual database online with an interesting dataset, pick some project I'd like to do with it, and then find tutorials in to how to use SQL to extract, clean, and manipulate data, and use them as I go.  That's pretty much how I've been learning statistical coding in both R and Python.  

The problem is, when I Googled variations of ""publicly available databases"", I just found freely available data_sets_, the same type of stuff I'd find if I Googled ""free datasets"".  I figure there have to be actual databases available to the public, because otherwise how would anyone self-teach SQL, but clearly I'm using the wrong search terms to find them. 

Part of the problem is perhaps that I haven't had a course on what databases even are really -- I just completed a DS minor, but all the projects and assignments we did involved using R and/or Python to read in data from a CSV or XLXS file. I have a general idea of what databases are and I figured I'd learn more about them as I started using SQL (I learned about data cleaning and manipulation almost entirely from doing projects in R) but right now I'm very much a newbie to databases.  

Does anyone have any suggestions for the search terms I should be using to find a database I can use for learning?

"Hello,

I am looking for feedback on an idea I'm working on.

It's a desktop application that will allow you to open the most common data file formats (CSV, JSON, Excel, Avro, Parquet etc.) and explore their contents in a nice table, you'll be able to search, filter, sort, group rows or run custom SQL.

From the table view you can also create charts and export them as images, or export a subset of the data as another data format, so you can effectively convert between data formats too.

In the future I might add some data cleansing features but for now it's just viewing / analyzing.

The idea is for this app to be kind of a data swiss knife, something you reach out when you have to quickly view a file and don't want to write a script or import the data in a database.

Although I didn't know him that well, I thought well this could be my opportunity. After he finishes talking on the phone I tell him ""excuse me, but did I hear you say Python?"". We start talking and it turns out a few people in the department are trying to work on a project and they want to use Python. So I go ahead and meet with them. It turns out they were looking for someone with programming skills who can implement their ideas. I have a few discussions with them, they send me a sample of the data, and I show them what I can do with it. They got excited so we spent a few weeks working on this project together. We finally get to a stage where the project is presentable.

I’m feeling a bit lost. Apologies ahead of time for the novel, I’m just hoping I can spark some good discussion, and maybe gain some motivation.

I’ve been working as a contractor for a small/medium-sized staffing firm for 10 years, on contract as a help desk/customer service manager at a large multi-national organization. Out of necessity, I started getting into data analysis, hit a wall with Excel, and decided to get a MS in business analytics. Now, equipped with passing knowledge of SQL and Python, growing intermediate R skills, some database management, expert Excel skills, and more than anything, a drive to make the business better, I’m trying to shift my position off of this contract, and more into my company’s headquarters operations as a lead data… person.

I’m constantly feeling unsure of myself, my skills, my ability to drive meaningful change in my company.

"\*\* Market Research for an idea \*\*  
Over the last 5 years I have worked for several companies as an Analytics Engineer (implementing tracking and tagging solutions) and Data Manager. 

My job normally included getting a picture of online and offline data and unite them. 

In each company I started auditing the different data and marketing platforms to understand the data structure, naming conventions and platform integration status. 

All of the companies I worked for had a big problem with old, cluttered and incorrect data.   
In one company we ripped out the complete tagging and tracking system and set up a brand new tag management system and platform end points (mainly Google Analytics, Databricks and some other platforms)  


In the other company I spent a very long time manually auditing the data and raising bug ticket after bug ticket to align data schema, streamline data endpoints and fix duplicated or broken properties. 

Even not being involved in one new website feature can mean derailing all naming conventions for that feature and headaches for any analysts or scientists who need to use that data further.   
I feel like this is a recurring theme in companies. Over time you get clutter or old data concepts that are no longer used due to team. focus or platform changes.   
I am currently investigating an automatic auditing solution for different data platforms, starting with the biggest, to quickly and easily get a view of what is currently collected and how.   
After this I would like to come up with automated platform enhancing tips based on best practices for that specific business (you are not using this GA feature, enabling this would give you x etc.)

You could also define conversion steps for different products/ areas of the website and see if the tracking is coherent or needs adjusting, simplifying the whole naming convention of your website tracking to keep it easy for analysts. 

 I would like to discuss with you if you also experience this problem in your companies and if it involves a lot of manual work that could benefit from an automated tool like the one described.

I ask because I see reports of the following:

* BMW using simulations in order to optimize factory layout
* There have been recent discoveries in Nuclear Fusion, and I have to believe that simulations were used to help set up those experiments.

"trigger alert - depressing post/rant ahead.

 

Our company cut its workforce by 33%, and our team shrank from 7 couples of working hands to 3. Most of the layoffs came after a long year of poor management and disconnection from evidence, which makes it even more infuriating.   

Besides the fact that now the current work will be divided among fewer people, I am sad that my friends got laid off, and feel lonely. In most cases, the DS/research team is somewhat isolated from the rest of the organization, making you an alien, having only three of us left, leaving me with very few people to talk to.  

I know it comes out a little funny that I am the one to complain after people lose their job. I really and truly feel sorry for them as well (thinking about their situation makes me sick and angry even more, as, again, the layoffs result from poor management). I just don't know how to deal with it, it's my first job after grad school, and stopping seeing friends whom I saw 3-4 times a week (and even more on evenings) really hits me hard (more than I thought it could).",How to deal with layoffs from the side of the remaining workforce,datascience

"I have someone in my team who is currently applying for one of the internal roles - a promotion 2 levels above her current level. I am on the interview panel but not her referee and therefore have to remain unbiased and take the information that was presented in the CV like I would for an external applicant.

This person has no technical skills, no understanding behind even simple concepts, just memorized a few things but is very interested in promotions and started asking about them 6 months into the role. Seems way more interested in promotions than learning DS :(

Anyway, I have seen plenty of people add about 20% to their CV, overstate their role in a project etc. This person has claimed that she has built 2 models that don't exist as a part of my team. She described techniques used and claims she has led the whole effort and the models are now deployed (these are techniques that I mentioned in team meetings, but always said that it will depend on the data. Turns out we didn't have enough good data so looks like these models will never be built. She is up to date on these developments). I am in a very large org and nobody really keeps track of new models etc.

On the basis of these lies, I have seen that she was invited for an interview. Many people that are way more talented but were more honest didn't. This really bothers me. I did mention it to my manager who seems disinterested and made a comment that I need to be building up junior DS and not tearing them down :(

"Title pretty much says it all. 

I have three coworkers  - Bob, Jack, and Jill. 

Bob spends most of his day asking people what they are working on where he then asks more questions with the intent of finding something he knows about so he can talk about it and essentially try to tell the other person how to do their job. Bob did this to me once and I told them to fuck off - they don't do it to me any more but plenty of people entertain Bob. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now Jack. I was recently put on a project with Jack and Jill and I work with Jack on other projects. Jack and Jill were writing code that is planned to be put into production and quite frankly the code base was shit but I never told them. I was asked to come in and extend the capabilities of their code base meanwhile Jack has done basically nothing since I have started on the project and Jill essentially only attends the meetings now. 

Today I was asking Jack about a portion of his code that gives inconsistent output for the same input and I asked him if knew why the API did this. Jacks response was basically telling me to add an if statement to his code to rerun a rejected request. More or less he dodged the actual question and averted to telling me to do some basic ass thing which I don't need him to tell me how to do; I'm quite confident that just about anyone with a pulse could come up with the same solution but it doesn't actually address the underlying problem and thus might not even be a solution at all. 

This interaction more or less summarizes the sentiment of my interactions with Jack.  Anytime I do good work to improve the code base he tries to claim credit for it in meetings and any time I ask him questions about the code he wrote his responses are deflective and generally shift into him trying to tell me how to code. I don't know if he is purposely being an ass or if he's just that aloof but it's really starting to get on my nerves. 

Now to Jill, Jill has two things going for her which are a language barrier and a superiority complex. We will be sitting in our weekly team meeting that she participates in where I give an outline of what I have accomplished, what I am still working on, where my work is going, and how it fits into the overall process map (which didn't exist so I made one). No shit, at the end of every meeting Jill basically tells me to do what I already said I was going to do except she does so explicitly outlining most of the things I already talked about where she does this with some new words for a twist. Maybe this is where the language barrier is a thing - I'm not sure but it's definitely annoying. 

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind that Jill and Jack are basically the same level as me, we have the same roles / responsibilities only they have masters degrees and less than 1 years work experience and I have a bachelors degree with a couple of years of work experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I've been on the project - Jill has basically done nothing but attend meetings and Jack, though he has done a slight amount of coding, has pretty much done the same. It's at the point where I don't even understand why our project lead keeps inviting them to the meetings / they keep showing up but that get's outside the intent of this post. 

&amp;#x200B;

To extend this further, I have noticed that in my org it's particularly common for the Data Scientists to walk around telling people what to do and that most of the work is probably done by 40% of the people where many of them just keep to themself.

My ideal career aim is to get into FAANG data manager role. There are many reasons I want to get into a managerial route but one of the key reasons is I'm tired of being an IC, leading multiple workstreams alone AND doing the hands on keyboard work whose complexity half of the stakeholders don't even understand. Plus ICs at tech have zero power/say

I joined my new role a few months ago for two reasons a) Opens doors to tech especially FAANG b) more opportunities to laterally move in data science adjacent roles like strategy or product manager
The con is I'm a small cog in a big machine and org is so huge it's impossible to create impact/grow or be visible.

Pro is : I noted in my interview process, interviewers are highly biased towards tech/non tech. If you're coming from non tech background it's harder to break into tech plus they'll definitely down level you

Is it easier to slog as an IC for 2-3 years in tech and eventually get to manager or am I better off going back to my analytics manager role gaining more experience for a few years and then trying to make the switch

"Hey guys,

I'm a recent graduate from a Data Science Masters program with a few previous years experience in data analyst roles.  I'm on the job market but things are slow for now and I have a lot of time on my hands.  I'm thinking of developing my skills set and thinking Deep Learning (maybe through [deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai)) might be a good next step, but I'm not sure whether there might be other, better things to learn first as I have heard on this subreddit that most people actually do not use neural nets much on a regular basis at all.

I have a career as an analyst and have generally been more interested in delivering insights and driving business decisions than ML.  Over my graduate career I developed strong fundamentals in statistics, some ML, experimentation and linear models.  The linear models course I took at the end of school got me very interested in predictive modeling in particular.  I see a lot of ML-focused roles asking for experience with Keras and Tensorflow, and think it may be time to pick up deep learning.  Funny - I never pictured myself getting into ML and I think my heart is still in analytics and product, but it could really widen the range of jobs I am applying to if I start picking it up.

Let me know your thoughts, or whether there are lower-hanging fruits than deep learning as I continue on the path of self-learning.  Also, recommendations on resources to use might be helpful.",Masters Grad with Analytics Background - Interested in ML - is DL the Next Step?,datascience

I'm working on a project and can't really figure out what the best approach is here. Effectively I have product sales for n=1,600 diff products over 24 quarters each, with each product having its own unique slope/curve over time (but certain categorical features of the products clearly tend to yield exponential decay curves, while other qualitative features yield more bell-shaped growth curves). I want to quantify -- with one variable if possible -- the nature of each product's curve, and identify which categorical features contribute to the exponential decay curves.

"Hi All,  


I am currently working as a data analyst in a consulting firm, I have been there for 1 year, and it's my first tech job. But I am finding I am struggling on the job, I have extremely low confidence in my coding abilities and skills. My background is an undergraduate degree in Business and a master's in Sociology/Data Analytics and I am in my late twenties.  


In my current project, I am one of the analysts, and I just find that all the coding I do is pull reports and edit code that others have written when maintaining our platform. I was given one project that went nowhere and other than that my supervisor/seniors on the team don't trust me with any other work. I have been given good feedback in performance reviews but I feel like I'm underperforming and I have no confidence in my skills. I have no drive to finish tasks and that makes me even more inefficient since I won't be given anything else to do or no feedback or advice. The platform we are working on is currently being migrated to another team which doesn't help with my lack of motivation and doesn't push others to give me more work to develop code.

I'm at a loss whether this just isn't the career path for me, I am terrible at reading others code for editing purposes, I don't have much experience coding and feel I'm slow at it, and I don't have a particularly strong aptitude for maths. In my masters, I worked my ass off to pass the statistics modules. 

I was considering studying for a postgraduate diploma to swap either into another area of CS like security networking, and testing or learn more about cloud architecture and move to data engineering. I am worried I'll have the same issues in those fields.

I have considered moving jobs but I feel like I have nothing to offer. I actually feel less confident in my abilities than when I got this job since my Python programming has gotten rusty and on paper, I look more impressive than I am. And I'm worried I'll have the same issues in my next role.

Has anyone else had a similar experience? Do you need to have very strong coding/maths skills in all areas of Data Science? Should I give up and move industry?

"I'm kind of in a difficult situation and considering leaving my job. I'm a AI student and was offered this job after I did a project with them for my bachelor in June. 

I was hired as a junior ML engineer, but sometimes I feel like they hired me because they want to do something with ML, but they actually don't know what. 

For example, I have worked on a project for about 2 months and turns out, my supervisor was working on some code with the exact same functionality without telling me. His code, a rule-based system, was deployed and mine not. Turns out that he still made me write the code because he thought I could use it to label the data to use it for a supervised ML project, before actually thinking if it would be a task that is even suitable for supervised ML. 

We have to give a presentation this Thursday on our goals for the future and my supervisor had to think for more than a week before being able to write down some goals. 

I feel like they should have hired a senior because my supervisor only started working 3 months before I took up the project in June and did not actually study AI of DS. 

It feels kind of useless to work on tasks without having a vision of what we are working towards. Besides that, I don't like the company culture. My boss made some sexist remarks in the past and because I'm the only non cisgender queer developer on the team, I sometimes feel like I'm in a sports canteen during lunch.

"Hey Reddit,  

My friend and I are building a project management platform for AI/data science teams (essentially a JIRA for ML). We aim to develop a data-centric, experimental tool that models the ML pipeline to organize workflows, building off the Agile methodology of software development. Our tool will allow ML engineers to design, track, and manage custom pipelines, data flows, and models all on the cloud. Below of a list of some features we plan to introduce:  

**Integrations**: Include a host of integrations to MLOps tools (KubeFlow, MLFlow, etc), cloud computing services (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), source code management (Github, Bitbucket)  

**Iterations**: Allow multiple iterations within pipelines, and separate each iteration by various steps in the ML pipeline (business understanding, data visualization, data pre-processing, model training, model testing, model optimization, and deployment). Include a Kanban chart per each part of the pipeline  

**Callbacks**: The ability to request to go back to previous stages of the AI pipeline to either improve previous steps (like data preprocessing or model training/development/designing) or request other teams to improve previous steps (we refer to this as callbacks)  

**Storage**: A cloud storage solution to store ML models, datasets, or any other metrics/graphs/whatever ML engineers want to store.  

**Sketchpad**: A sketchpad to design data flows and ML models, and link them to code  Private Assignment: The ability to individually/uniquely assign tasks to different roles in a team, and the ability to be able to privately and specifically send vital information to specific people. for example, the pm could only send the data set to the data engineer, the preprocessed data to an ML engineer (potentially added on top of all this is a differential privacy layer), and send the packaged model to an integration engineer.  

**Chat**: A chat/communication platform to interact w/ your team  Quantitative Focus: ML is quantitative. The client wants QUANTITATIVE results. Hence, the epic should be emphasized on being quantitative rather than qualitative.  

**Experiments**: We redefine “sprints” as “experiments.” We make two changes to sprints. First, we DO NOT have any deadlines on any sprints. This is to not put the engineer under pressure. Secondly, instead of asking “what”, we ask “how” when asked to describe the experiment. This provides a heavily qualitative focus on the experiments, with a focus on function rather than immediate deliverability as in software engineering.

"One of the recent studies, published in ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems, shows the potential of graph analytics in identifying the enduring effects of pandemics on healthcare systems. By analyzing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) data with a framework that combines exploratory, explanatory and predictive analyses, the authors were able to identify patterns and structures that could be used to detect the long-term effects of the virus. The findings suggest that graph analytics can provide more accurate and comprehensive insights compared to traditional methods and have important implications for efforts to detect, track and combat pandemics like COVID-19.

The Marketing team of our company wants to work on a Cross Selling Model. But, they are not interested in New Users, they want to know who are the users that we currently have that did not Cross Sell into another product but are more likely to do it.

So, in my mind, I was prepared to work on New Users, the population of our model would be New Onboardings of Product A, and our target would be the Users that Cross Sell to Product B in a time frame since they acquire Product A. But they are not interested in this.

So base on the requirements of the problems, it seems more likely a Look Alike model, do you agree with that? 

I was thinking also on giving them our train score predictions, in my mind, what they were asking for are the False Positives, I mean, when the model predicts that the user will cross sell but it was a mistake.

Last week I came across a very interesting law called the Benford's Law, which states that if you select any real-life dataset, and separate the leading digits from all the records of a numeric column — the most frequently occurring digit will always be 1. Infact, 30% of all the leading digits will be 1.

I was very fascinated by this and decided to test this theory myself. I analyzed wide ranging datasets - from Virat Kohli's ODI test runs, to Delhi's Air Quality Index, to Lok Sabha election votes and even the Calories in Starbucks drinks!

My company works with two blogger clients: client A with around 5k total monthly readers and client B with around 100k. Each has a newsletter they promote via a CTA that appears on every page view, and, on average, A gets about 20 new subscribers per month for the newsletter, while B does 800.

For each client, my task is to find a ""smarter"" way to display this CTA to readers than merely showing it on every page view, sort of a question of figuring out the ""when"" for each reader so as to improve conversion rate.

"I'm looking for options to work flexible hours as a data scientist. I value my free time more than my paycheck. I'm looking to work part time full remote (just grind out 20 hours a week instead of working 40 hour corporate job). I have a couple years experience as a DS under my belt, mostly in DoD, which is not friendly to working remotely outside the US. So I'm thinking of maybe working for a consulting company or big tech consulting (AWS or azure) for a year to get experience, then jump into some type of 1099 contracting role with my own LLC that I would setup.

What I'm thinking is to approach startup or smaller companies, who can't afford to hire a data scientist full time at $200k, but they still could leverage data expertise on a part time basis. From my job, I've realized the most data immature companies have the greatest marginal return, where they have some data management need that's tied to their bottom line. I would come in, help them setup a cloud environment, data management practices, ETL system, any type of algorithm if it's required, tie it to some relevant output (dashboards, reports, etc.), and then teach someone at the company how to operate it. (I've done this with analysts at my job) then I can return periodically to maintain the product for them.

"BLUF: no degree but heaps of knowledge and experience in engineering, cybersecurity, and DS/ML.

I'm a seasoned cybersecurity analyst (threat hunter) and have been focusing on applied statistics, data science, and machine learning (classical and deep learning) for the past few years. I also am a full-stack engineer, which helps when creating tools and analytics. I've taught myself statistics and probability, linear algebra, and a little calculus, as it's necessary for fully grasping a lot of DS/ML frameworks and methodologies.

I've really struggled with imposter syndrome since I've started trying to break into data science and machine learning. It seems almost everyone has a masters (or two) or a PhD. Education-wise, I have enough credits for an Associates but didn't get the degree. I was working on a BS at the time, so getting the AS on paper didn't seem important. I'm extremely outclassed when it comes to degrees. However, what I do have is a considerable amount of domain knowledge, the ability and dedication to learn new topics, and a decent amount of data science and machine learning knowledge.

I've performed time series analysis (ARIMA, STL decomp, P/ACF plots, forecasts), built predictive models and classifiers (kernalized SVM,  decision trees, XGBoost/Random Forest), and have played around with GMMs, latent profile/class analysis, ICA and PCA, and t-SNE. I've also built a CNN and have built and used an autoencoder for anomaly detection. I mention all of that to demonstrate that I've gained a small amount of knowledge and experience and to get feedback on how that might stack up against other data scientists or other candidates trying to break into the field. I don't know how to showcase these particular KSAs without an advanced degree backing it up. I was able to pass both the Python and Machine Learning assessments on LinkedIn. The Python one had some linear algebra and data science questions, which surprised me. The Machine Learning assessment was a huge boost in confidence as an affirmation of what I've learned and how far I've come. It's laughable in the comparison and I would never bring it up in an interview, add it to my resume, or use it as a true credential, but it helped me out spiritually.

I'm not wanting to step away from cybersecurity, rather I'd like to bring DS/ML knowledge to bear on the longstanding problems within the industry, namely modernizing defender and detection capabilities. Right now, I largely work alone within a larger analyst community. I occasionally link up with some of the data scientists and machine learning engineers with the organization but I'd like to work closer. Trying to find that path really reveals my limited qualifications. Most positions have degree requirements that are at the grad school level and I can't compete in that arena. Could I make up for the lack of degree with certifications? Preferably ones that don't themselves have degree requirements (eg, aCAP requires a masters). If so, what certs would you recommend?

I have 17 years of experience in the broader IT field with the last 6-7 years being in a cybersecurity specialization.

I'm in the blessed situation that my Data Science training has paid off and i now have some job offers to chose from. I write in hopes of getting some advice from some of you pros in regards which job offers i should accept. Mostly because the jobs seems to be in different ""clusters"" under the term Data Science. Its essentially a choice between:

1. Traditional Data-analysis in a scrum environment. Lots of data cleaning and exploratory analysis. Low pay, medium IT-skill.

2. Data-analysis oriented towards Business Intelligence including automation/ETL, SQL, PowerBI and more socially interactive in conveying results and helping non-analyst coworkers. Medium pay but higher potential, low-medium IT skill.

3. Straight DS including working in an Agile/Scrum environment, mainly doing analyst + machine learning to find solutions to a multitude of services in the public county. Low pay, high IT skill.

And then without job offers but still relevant there the 4th path: More SWE focused paths which includes more coding, having to either simple front end duties or learn about unit testing, data structures/algorithms and other languages but Python (C, java or the like). MLOps og MLE futures. Medium pay, high IT skill. Much for me to learn.

Since i don't have any experience yet i'm not sure which direction i personally prefer. I think i'm best off just getting any experience. But already now i have the choice to impact my DS career by which job i accept. However i think the business job sounds good because i will learn basic ETL, automation, more like all-around IT skills, but i'm also afraid of it not being technically advanced enough and i'll be stuck as a dashboard and simple descriptive statistics monkey that will always be a business guy. Then theres the more ""IT solid"" jobs that has a better IT infrastructure already, more technical coworkers, agile procedures, but whats the future in this? I will just stand on what others have built perhaps and not advance in regards to social aspects or domain knowledge.

So i was wondering if you pros knows anything about these domains? Whats the most solid choice? What would you do if you just started out? I know its kinda hard to answer without knowing personal preferences but its still a choice to be made and any wisdom is appreciated!

Greetings, I've just recently received a project from one of my clients in which they would like to develop a recommender system. The company is related to education. 

Thus, they would like to have a system that can recommended a list of courses to the user based on their input/personality/characteristics/etc. 

I've never worked on this kind of system so I'm a bit lost. What I have gathered is, in recommender systems, they are a few ways to go about this. 

The first approach that I've seen is called Content-based filtering. The second would be collaborative filtering. 

Content-based filtering is simply suggesting items that are similar to the items that the user is fond of. For instance, I like Apple juice, so it is possible that I might like Orange juice as well. (Hopefully my understanding is correct).

For collaborative filtering on the other hand, the suggestions are not based on the content/items, but rather on how similar the users are among each other. For instance, I like Apple juice, and a friend of my likes Apple and Orange juice. So, since we have some similarity with one another, he suggests me to have Orange juice. So, I'm guessing this is how collaborative filtering works. 

What I'm having trouble right now is, how am I supposed to go about this for recommending online courses? If I were to go with collaborative filtering, I would need a lot of users in my system. So, let's assume that there's not much traffic in the system as of now. This would result in inaccurate recommendations. 

If I were to go with content-based filtering, I would need the user to enter a few courses that they have enrolled before. I think..   


Both of these approaches have a similar problem which is called ""cold-start problem"". In which, I would need some input from them, in order to make some ""viable"" recommendations.

What if I were to make a survey, and based on their input, I would recommend them a list of courses based on what they chose? If I were to choose this approach, I can't see how the data would look like, or even how I'm supposed to train the model for recommending. On top of that, I don't see how I'm going to export the model and apply it to a REST API. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do let me know your thoughts regarding these approaches as well as my understanding on this concept. Thank you so much in advance.

P.S.

"Hello I am working on my first data science project and my hypothesis is that colexification (when words share a meaning) increases with high levels of affect and arousal.

So I have this dataset where I’ve extracted all the words that have a shared meaning, and how many different languages that they have a shared meaning accross. I’ve then taken two lists of words with their affect value (-1 to 1) and arousal value same scale. And extracted all the word pairs with a value. 

So I extracted the top and bottom quartiles of the most and least colexified words across languages. 

I was told that a t-test would be a good test for my hypothesis but I can’t exactly figure out how to do that?  Would I be doing a single t-test and using what mean? The mean for the whole set or just the sample? 
Or a paired t-test? 
There’s 18000 words in the top quartile, and I did a linear regression and it has a small positive Pearson r value for affect and small negative r for arousal which fits my theory.

"Hello everyone,

I found the posts of other users who successfully transitioned into data science to be very helpful and encouraging in dealing with my own feelings of rejection and self doubt. 

I just accepted a position as an econometrician in advertising tech, without any relevant real world experience (internships, jobs, etc.).

Here is the summary of my experience.

\- Went back to undergrad for two semesters to brush up on calculus, econometrics, and statistics

\- That got me into a fairly well reputed STEM Econ MA program.

\- I took elective coursework in statistical learning, game theory, Python/SQL/GCP for big data, and of course, lots of work in R in econometrics.

\- I did several ML/DS projects to reinforce my skills and learn independently, and competed on Kaggle

\- I completed the IBM deep learning with PyTorch cert on coursera, and posted two tutorials on how to build neural nets for simple binary classification and convolutional networks for multi-class classification

\- I made three resumes for specific fields (tech, consulting, and general)

Over the course of 2.5 months: 

I made 143 job applications 

Had 11 phone screens

Had 4 technical assessments

Received 2 offers

On it's face, it seems like a numbers game, but that really doesn't capture how involved the process was. With each rejection, I resolved to be better.

\- Was the code in my repos filled with detailed comments?... No, I fixed that

\- Was my github organized, professional, with detailed readmes?.. No, I fixed that

\- Was I blindly applying? Yes, so I started reaching out to other data scientists for advice and referrals

\- Was my resume showing projects that highlight desired skillsets? No.. you get the picture.

All in, this took me about two years to go from someone with no coding, math, or statistics background to break into the field. 

If I can do it, you can probably do this faster and better... but this was just my experience.

"Hey there, 

I currently work as an accountant who has been cursed with being assigned what I’ll call the “pedestrian” data science tasks of my department. I currently am hating my life not because of the relatively easy technical asks, but because of the impasse we’ve hit surrounding data controls. 

Being accounting related, all of the data flows to the general ledger as a journal entry. Generally speaking, the more subledger detail encoded into each journal entry, the more well constructed the G/L is. However, the company I am working for refuses to change how they record and enter JEs, and especially are not willing to discuss implementing data controls. Their current process is to post 1 entry per country for each applicable transaction type. Without getting too deep into accounting, this would be like if you received your credit card bill as a lump sum and you had to try and figure out separately which specific items composed the total from your receipts, but none of your receipts said what they were for or where the transaction took place...and you had receipts from 47 countries in different currencies where the currency isn’t even listed...I digress 

The resulting data set is ambiguous. The desired work around (which I vocally do not support) is to use static tables with the hypothesized transaction drivers loaded and pray the results align to the actual results. The massive requirement for manual maintenance of the static tables makes operating the model entirely redundant, and the results that it can produce are not at all something I’m comfortable presenting. 

I am starting to worry that this data science ask is going to ruin my accounting career. What would you guys do to solve this and deliver a usable model? How do you data scientists push for better data when you’re being pelted with the unrealistic asks for the quality of data provided? Especially when no one will grant you agency in the underlying processes.

"Hi all,

I graduated recently with a relevant master's degree and have experience in picking up on problem statements up until delivering the best performing model and a presentation for my results but have no experience and getting from there to actually deploying the model.

Currently, I am working as a junior alone, and have been in charge of multiple projects one of which has to move to deployment through AWS.

I've been connected with other Data Scientists internally, none of which was either involved with AWS or willing to help (WTF?). Thus, I am left alone to figure out how to do it as everyone expects that from me, I  raised my troubles to my manager, he is really trying but honestly no luck in finding a combo of a person who knows and wants to help out yet.

I am more than happy to get on it alone, however before starting on how to do something I have to learn what it is. Thus, I look for steps I should take to move from my academically written code to the place  I get to have it deployed in AWS. Below are some questions I have, ignore any if they sound weird as it is the confused me who probably got something wrong

* Should I use pipelines? An example?
* Break the code into multiple files per part (e.g. a file for data cleaning and another for modeling)
   * What should the insides of the file be, a function?
* Should I create python packages for my functions?
* Please mention any other steps I have no idea should take place.

"Hi, I’ve run into a situation at my company and was wondering what all the smart people on here thought would be a good approach. 

My company released a new feature for an app that was awarded on a first-come-first-serve basis (the user had to pay 5000 of the in-app currency to unlock it). We allowed only 1,000 users to “purchase” this feature and it sold out in 2 days (there are roughly 80,000 active users a week). 

My job is to measure the impact this feature has on user behaviour. Naturally, there is a ton of bias in the users that have purchased this feature (accounts are older, users are more active on specific parts of the app, different demographics than our general user demo, etc). The core way I know about to test impact of a feature is through AB testing, but since this was not set up as an AB test, I need to explore alternative options. 

So far what I’ve done is use propensity matching on the “treatment” group vs all of the other users that don’t have access to this feature to try and find a comparable control group. For practical reasons, I propensity matched on about 8 different variables. Since there are many more variables that I can’t guarantee are equally distributed between the two groups, I decided to do a difference-in-difference test to evaluate the lift. 

Additionally, when the 1,000 spots sold out, a lot of users joined a wait list for the next time this feature could be purchased. I did a difference-in-difference (DID) test using this group as well. When comparing the DID from the wait list users vs the propensity matched users, I’m getting different results. One says something like an improvement of 10% while the other shows a decrease of 8%. 

Does what I did make sense? Is there a better way to approach this?

The purpose of these projects is to practice my Data Science skills and create a journey for myself and others into data science while creating interesting projects. This is week 8 of my learning journey!!.

In this project, we analyse How and why some universities excel in south-east Asia and QS Ranking as a system as a whole.

Here are some Key findings.

1. QS ranking although very reputed, they have a long way to go before properly ranking all universities comprehensively.
2. Some universities lose rank because they are specialist universities and we must take that into consideration when comparing with other universities.
3. International outlook and students play a very important role in the university ranking and therefore must be an integral part of the university and maybe they should be given more opportunities to make them join the university in the first place.
4. Japan leads most of the South Asian universities, but Malaysian universities have seen a promising rise over the past 5 years and may have a great outlook moving forward

Now, when I look at DE job offers the requirements are really different from these task.
I'm puzzled because I would like to find a job with the same activities ( troubleshooting infrastructure,scheduling, pipelines, automatizing )

 but I'm not able to know if DE , Platform Engineer , Quality Data Engineer, which role is right.

"Hello, 

everyone

I failed the 2nd assessment test and HR maild me Im no longer part of next round.

I Recently applied to a company from my desired job location and pay  ( extremely rare)
In the 1st round they gave me a basic task to find some answers from data with your preferred language. I cleared the round help of googling ( officially allowed).

Now, in the 2nd round they said you'll have to take another assessment test.( I had no idea what it was about)

So I started taking exams and now it was on full screen so cannot use a calculator or anything and the exam turned out to be 60 questions in 60 minutes and consisted of 3 parts: logical reasoning, data interpretation/aptitude, English.

So I started with English and data interpretation because obviously I cannot do without using a calculator or pen paper ( i tried and was looking for paper but it immediately spotted that i was looking away from the screen and gave me a warning) so it was the only option.

I'm not native English speaker but still decent with questions but here are a few questions where I need to answer from comprehension ( time taking at least for slow readers like me) 

So I could not complete the entire exam in time and now I think this was a little bit unfair from them

So the question is should I contact an HR and try and talk to them about what happened?
OR
Forgot about it ? this is too desperate a move (Which I am)


I'm feeling pathetic after this got rejected by a good company in the final round prior to this and later got almost scammed by a fake company this is the 3rd one and I messed up big time.

Edit: thank you everyone for going through the long post.

"I have no prior knowledge in data science, but have a pretty typical data science project I would like to have done. I am unsure whether its feasible to learn to do this myself, or I am better off outsourcing it to someone via upwork (or something)

**THE PROJECT**
I would like to create a stock market database from which I can filter stocks according to specific criterias. Ie.:

* Print a list of all stocks which gapped up 4%, or more, in the last 5 years
* Print a list of all stocks which positive earnings surprise in the last 5 years
* Of the stocks with positive earnings surprise what was the avrage gain?

**THE SOLUTION**
This should be doable using a stock market api (ie. finanicalmodelingprep), excel, streamlit (or many other tools). My problem is that I would be starting from scratch.. Would this be doable as a weekend, or two, project?

"Greetings, need some guidance or mentorship to kickstart my career once again. Yet another mediocre as per Indian society just having high-end aspirations. People started saying my life is in a complicated state, and I agree as well. I did Maths as my UG and later decided some Post Graduation (did in entrepreneurship and marketing) would help to reach where I aspire to be but didn't go that way, got a decent job as an ERP consultant with 4.2LPA as a fresher but found that is also a very long typical journey so decided to learn #DataScience (thought UG and PG would add up as maths and domain knowledge for DS). but no money to opt for big courses so decided to learn self. But it isn't as motivating as the regular structured way of learning since the path and results are unforeseeable. Now after spending (wasted) 7 months (learnt 20% of the course may be) after leaving my job. No idea what else to do to move forward in life. 

So my questions are, 

1. I am ready to continue my self-learning journey if companies or market demand accept, by looking at my skill and online projects, also will it be stressful even to get called for an interview?  Is it okay to do self-learning, moving forward with a DataCamp subscription and other free learning portals? 

 2. Or if companies prefer some degree or course, should I opt for some courses (3-4L) 6/12 months where they allow ISA (Income sharing agreement) payment mode which is paying after getting placed? (Financial constraints won't allow for paying upfront). Already I got an education loan to repay but I am fine to add more debt if it pays well.

3. Any new ideas? Confused. No idea what to do...

"Hello all,

I've recently started my first job after graduating from my bachelors in chemistry. One of the things I'm going to do is analyse the data from our mobile measuring systems which measures the composition and calorific value of green gas/biogas/biomethane. A measurement is done every 6 minutes for 4 weeks and we analyse 10-30 components, depending on the type of gas, so that's quite a bit of data (to me at least). The software that comes with the hardware automatically writes all the data in a .txt file which we copy and put in Excel. After this everything is manually checked and graphs are manually made after which a report is manually written.

I know this can be done way easier and faster but I'm not sure what skills I need to learn so I thought who to better ask than the experts themselves. I've started learning python but I'm not sure where to go from there. Preferably I would like to use a dashboard that shows the most important data and updates every 6 minutes (every measurement).

"Hi,

I am currently a software engineer/developer. But am thinking about changing careers to either Data Science or Business and Finance.

I am trying to get a feel for what Data Science will be like compared to what I am doing right now. The things that have me thinking about changing are the unpredictable long hours and the amount of troubleshooting and debugging that goes into just making sure an app is going to work.

I do not mind taking work home once in awhile. But between all of the languages (C#, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, etc.) and the frameworks (.NET, BootStrap, Vue.JS, etc.) I find myself having to study CONTATNLY! I would rather be able to have to study a core of tools/concepts that will go a long way for a long time, instead of having to study every-time I am off of the clock or on the weekends.

The next item is how every-time I build something, it never works the first time and I have to build it again. I find myself saying, ""Why isn't this working?"" more times than I would like to. (One software architect I talked to said that's why he transitioned from development). And then doing this on top of a deadline just magnifies the stress.

I have a feeling that you will probably tell me, ""Dude...that's how it is in data science too!"" But I just need to ask if anybody who has made this transition can tell me what it was really like and if it sounds like a good fit for me.

"To me, there's a growing discrepancy between how the applications of AI are becoming more and more impressive and interesting and how actually working with AI is getting more and more tedious, at least in the industry.

A few years ago, tackling a new project was exciting. I had to wrangle the data, read a bunch of papers to find the best model, possibly implement it myself if no public implementation existed, train it, test it, etc. But the field is getting increasingly dependent on immense models and huge datasets that only big tech companies can dream of training. In the past year, I have worked mostly with NLP. I haven't had to touch tensorflow/keras/pytorch ONCE. All I do is reuse existing models through an API and possibly engineer the input a little bit to get the most out of it. Even fine tuning has become too resource dependent to realistically tackle most of the time.

The papers I've read recently are also pretty repetitive, most of them can be summed up as Google/Facebook/Amazon announcing ""So, we took a transformer, added 50 billion parameters and a new dataset and the results improved! Surprise!"".

So, what do I do all day if I'm not actually manipulating data and models? Well, I have become a software developer by another name. The thing is: I don't particularly enjoy software engineering. I know that, to some people, coding is like puzzle solving. But to me, it's like a frustrating never ending game of whack-a-mole. I precisely went for a data scientist role because I didn't want to be stuck in boring discussions about which function of which library of which framework will satisfy the biggest amount of programming principles. Unfortunately, that's pretty much all I do these days.

I even changed jobs recently because I felt like I had just become a glorified software developer. But guess what: Meet the new job, same as the old job. The only data sciency part here is the one time a month I actually send an API request to a model I didn't even train.

I know software development has always been part of the job, but it went from something I did while waiting for my model to give results to something I do all the time. I legit think somebody who knows how to code but has never touched a statistics book or trained a model could do my job.

I don't know what to do. I have a master's degree but no PHD, so I don't think moving from industry to research would be easy for me. Big tech companies don't have much of a presence where I live, and the application process is soul crushing. I almost want to move to education, because it would allow me to stay up to date with the field while sharing my passion for AI with other people, but I don't have any education-related diploma that would allow me to actually teach (plus, the most interesting work would be uni professor, but since I'm not a researcher that's almost impossible).

I am currently a freshie in my first analytics role out of college (graduated this past May) and I am actively exploring various career paths, both traditional and non-traditional.

Having followed a few ""data science"" influencers on LinkedIn for quite some time now, I've noticed a common theme that organizations are in need of data management that understands modern data infrastructures better. And after taking a look at Data Management as well as DAMA's (a unified global data management community that sets standards essentially) book on Data Management best current practices...I've come to decide that a career in Data Management might be for me. There seems to be a good balance between traditional management responsibilities with top-down leadership of all data-related activities within an organization. ([This Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_management) provides a decent overview of the field and DAMA's DMBOK outlines.) A few questions for those familiar with the field:

1. What would be a career path for those in a Data Manager role? It seems that Data Governance and CDO are common exit-roles, but what possibility of moving into a traditional analytics manager role might exist?
2. Why is the pay for this role not as relatively high as other data career roles? I see the national average is 80-90k/yr, which is decent, but not as much as a data analytics manager, let alone a data science management position.

 I hope you are doing fine. I am currently in the process of designing a comparative analysis that shall contrast the differences between various forecasting methods. I am trying to predict stock returns by running a cross-sectional regression using various factor inputs. However, no matter what I do, each and every regression receives a negative out-of-sample r2 score.

I checked everything and could not find any error in my code. I tried manipulating the data but even that did not help improve the r2 values.

Here is my code to run the regression:

                elif regmodel=='Ridge':
    
                    model = Ridge(alpha = alpha)

    OLS_predictions.reset_index(inplace=True)
    
    stock_data = regression_df.groupby('permno').apply(lambda x: x.iloc[window:])
    stock_data = stock_data.reset_index(drop=True)
    OLS_results = stock_data.loc[:,['permno','date', 'fwd_daily_exret']]
    OLS_results
    
    OLS_results = pd.merge(OLS_results,OLS_predictions, how='left', on=['permno','date']) 
    display(OLS_results)
    
    OLS_metrics = calculate_metrics_linear(OLS_results, 'fwd_daily_exret','OLS_pred', 'OLS_metrics', n_factors)
    display(OLS_metrics)

the calculation for the r2 is done using:

    def calculate_metrics_linear(df, true_variable_name, predicted_variable_name, dataframe_name, len_factors):
        r2= r2_score(df[true_variable_name],df[predicted_variable_name])
        r2_adj = 1-(1-r2)*(len(df[predicted_variable_name])-1)/((len(df[predicted_variable_name])-len_factors-1))
        MSE = mean_squared_error(df[true_variable_name],df[predicted_variable_name])
        rss = np.sum((df[predicted_variable_name]-df[true_variable_name])**2)
    
        df_metrics =  pd.DataFrame(data=[r2,r2_adj,MSE, rss])
        df_metrics=df_metrics.rename(index={0:'r2',1:'r2_adj', 2:'MSE', 3:'RSS'},columns={0:dataframe_name})
        return df_metrics
    

The r2 score I receive are:

OLS: -0.14

Lasso: -0.23

Ridge: -0.24

&amp;#x200B;

But I always end up having negative r2 scores and I can not find the error. Did someone else ever experience something similar? Or am I having a mistake somewhere?

"Q: Which are the best resources for learning data structures and algorithms (both theory and exercises), using Python?

I worked at a FAANG in a research scientist role for 6 years. I was deep in R programming and time series. I've been on sabbatical for two years. I'm rusty. I want to achieve some more breadth before hitting the interview trail. I want to target being able to pass the data scientist interview. That means I need to learn DS&amp;A. Also, I'd like to be able to solve interview problems using Python.

Some options which are close, but not quite there:

* **LeetCode**: Great for slamming DS&amp;A problems in Python. But I need to learn the underlying concepts as well.
* [***Algorithms***, by Sedgewick](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X): Classic. Has an accompanying Coursera course. But all done in Java. Also, a bit above my level at this point.
* [CSLR](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-fourth-Thomas-Cormen/dp/026204630X/): Classic. But even further above my level than Sedgewick's. Also, no Python.
* [*Grokking Algorithms*](https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious-ebook/dp/B09781V6F7)*:* For beginners. Examples in Python. Doesn't have a ton of coverage. But I have to start somewhere. Maybe combine this with CodeWars, LeetCode, etc.?
* [*Elements of Programming Interviews in Python*](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Python-Insiders/dp/1537713949/): Another good resource for slamming problems. Being that it's a book, I'm guessing it provides a little more conceptual context than LeetCode
* [*Data Structures and Algorithms in Java*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0672324539): Obviously, this doesn't use Python and that's my issue with it. But I'm including it here as the Java equivalent of what I'm looking for. It has absolutely glowing reviews. 
* Java book + my own Python implementations: Just use one of the excellent DS&amp;A books in Java and implement the examples myself in Python.","Resources for learning data structures and algorithms, using Python?",datascience

"I'm working on a model to forecast how much of a particular product a clothing retailer should buy to make up for the demand. The goal of the model is, of course, to maximize profit.

Currently I have a time series with 3 years of daily sales for that particular product.

I was arguing with a friend over which variables are even relevant here, should we consider promotions and price drops? What about holidays? What if the product was later returned by the client?   
If the product sold out but only after multiple promotions, we should conclude it was a mistake to buy it in the first place, correct? Demand is a function of price. And we want to maximize profit.

The hiring manager asked me if I want my title to be Lead Data Scientist or Lead Machine Learning Engineer, and I'm struggling to decide what to go with.

A little about me:
I've been working for about six years in data science and data science-adjacent roles. I've always been ""full stack"" as I'll do the whole pipeline:
- Speaking with stakeholders
- Setting up the experimentation framework (dockerized Jupiter sandbox with version control)
- Data Engineering (mostly feature engineering from existing warehouse data, but sometimes have to go out and grab data from other teams or APIs)
- EDA
- Model training (on cloud providers)
- Sharing results with stakeholders
- Batch Inference (dumped to a data warehouse or object store typically, deployed to cloud)
- API deployment (if needed, most of the time I try to make it a batch solution)

So I do everything end to end and I enjoy it. But I'm not really an expert at either... I use off the shelf models with heavy feature engineering, and my cloud deployment boils down to ""what is the easiest way to run a docker container on a schedule or event"".

"I've seen lots of articles and the like explaining binary cross entropy and they all seem to miss a pretty obvious (imo) interpretation.. so I feel like I'm going mad. 

so here it is

if you have a set Y of observed binary events and a set Z predictions then the binary cross entropy is basically a modified version of the probability of observing Y given Z is the true distribution for Y. 

that modification is taking the negative average log. my assumption is that you take the log just to keep the loss linear for minimization functions and negative since you want to minimize it. 

example: 
Y = [1,0]
Z = [0.8,0.1]

P(Y|Z) = 0.8 * (1-0.1)

log probs = LN(0.8 * 0.9) = ln(0.8) + ln(0.9) 

then just take the negative average.

"The long and short of my story is - I’m in my late 20’s, got my undergrad in business, previously worked in Biz Management and found my way into Data Science through a Data Viz job. I’m getting my Computer Science (DS focus) degree online as well. It’s been a hard transition. One I enjoy, but don’t feel like I’m skilled at.

This job’s my first technical job of any sort. I work in agile development sprints, correspond with data engineers, and have tools like SQL/Salesforce/AWS that I’m in and out of. I love the job - but I know I’m not skilled. I have basic SQL experience, but nothing like my boss. She’s super technical, can edit and workshop queries just by guessing and moving stuff around. I have practiced a bit but am so overwhelmed by all my company data. I’m exposed to a lot more data. I struggle with exploratory analysis. 

I think I’m analytically minded but not confident. When we brainstorm ideas for visuals…a lot of the time I just say Net Demand of X. Not percentages, different types of values and equations. I do well when told what to do, but am bad at coming up with my own ideas. Again..:overwhelmed. I think I’m not confident. And look this isn’t some intensive engineering job, it’s a lot of dashboarding, but this project is used company-wide and I’m the sole rep on it. There’s a lot of pressure: my pay went up 50k to 75k and I feel intense pressure to be worth it. 

We had our first dashboard review today. I worked for hours on it. It’s on a Salesforce Tableau vs regular Tableau, so lots of limitations and a weird JSON coding element. It’s been an adjustment for me. Instead of SQL there’s “SAQL.” Instead of learning the language ive just been using the widget tools in the app, which is easier but limiting. Either way, I worked on the dashboard maybe for 4 days during the work day, and I spent tons of free time on it - probably until 8am. And after receiving feedback, we still need lots of changes. 

I get that’s part of it. My boss said it was nice progress and that I have “good instincts.” What made me nervous however was, we tag team this visualization aspect with a company that provides us with contractors. The woman I was working with doesn’t have much businesses sense. Her contributions were really rough around the edges. My boss had a hard time confining her disbelief in how bad it was on call. And the week prior, the same employee presented another dashboard with similar negative feedback.

Anyways, my boss pings me and says she spoke with the contractor’s boss (who also works for that company) and she was removed from the team today. Just like that. I know my boss said it wasn’t on me but she’s basically like “this isn’t working out with X, she’s out.” It was just so sudden. She is a contractor from an external company, and I’m internal …as well as an internal hire. But it happened so fast. Two bad dashboards and she’s out. It made me worry my job isn’t secure? But it could be totally different. My boss isn’t in love with that contractor company, but they did find a replacement whos supposedly more tenured on the platform. 

Anyways, I’m more or less venting. But I’m scared I won’t pick this up fast enough? I spend a lot of time in widgets. I feel like I’m not asking these smart analyst kinds of questions. Just…the exploratory analysis doesn’t come to me by my own volition. It can come up in conversation, but when I’m alone and trying to think, I feel so overwhelmed and I blank. Nothing comes, just a blank. And then I worry I’ll get fired. My boss is very kind. But she’s very smart and this job pays 75k…which isn’t a ton in DS, but it’s a ton to me. My old boss was very lax. My new one is kind but there’s expectations, which I love. My old job was miserable and monotonous, I’d be done by noon. But I’m starting to fear I’ll never be good at SQL, learning in the Salesforce app takes too long so I won’t find it, and I won’t ask enough good questions to become an analyst one day. Plus…I love data viz too. I want to be good at this. I got hired based off my reporting efforts at my old job. But I feel like I’m
Not good enough.

I know this is needlessly long and I’m sorry. I’m really stressed. I work super late to refine things on the dashboard. But I don’t feel smart, I don’t feel technical and I’m overall a bit scared of my job security - even though I’ve been told nothing to suggest that. Just seeing someone else go scares me. Plus now I’m taking her work. But we’ll see. Just any advice is helpful

Currently work in structured finance, my first ft job from undergrad and about a year in.

I also have been seeing better reviews in terms of pay and WLB which I value. I am also reaching out to Columbia to learn as much as I can, but I am still aware they will always try to sell me on something so I take their information with a grain of salt as of now.

They also say Columbia did a good job at helping them finance the 1year program at around $75k. They, like I did, came from an econ background and said the coding was hard but manageable and they thought it was worth it. After talking to my professors who helped my classmates, they also think it would be a good fit for me. 

**Bootcamp:** Its a shorter period of time, and cheaper. I value the holistic education of a masters, but taking on so much debt and leaving my finance job for a completely new field is daunting. With a Bootcamp, its feasible to do it part-time and keep my current finance job. I would still have an income as I take class, and there would not me a financial constraint when I complete it and look for new work as I would have my finance job as a safety net. 

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts on a Bootcamp as opposed to a masters? Are there other pro/cons I should be thinking about? In the job world, how do people view a bootcamp vs masters? If i have little prior knowledge (apart from econometrics and STATA, sadly didnt learn R) would a bootcamp be too cut and dry ?

"Hey there, 

We wanted to share a library that we've been working on for a while. It's called [`OcrPy`](https://github.com/maxent-ai/ocrpy) - a Python library for doing OCR++. 

At its core the library aims to unify a multitude of OCR systems (commercial &amp; open-source) and provides a consistent and unified interface, along with a lot of additional functionalities that are usually really useful in practice - such as identifying the type of documents, the different types of layout's they come in etc and in turn processing them in different approaches.

Once you parse these docs, it also lets you index and enable searching over these collections via semantic search. 

with that said, here are the links to the python library, documentation &amp; tutorials.

1. Github: https://github.com/maxent-ai/ocrpy
2. Documentation: https://maxentlabs.com/ocrpy
3. Overview: https://maxentlabs.com/ocrpy/overview
4. Tutorial: https://maxentlabs.com/ocrpy/examples

Tl;dr of the library:

![](https://maxentlabs.com/ocrpy/_images/ocrpy-workflow.png)

- It supports various types of ocr cloud backends like AWS-textract, google-cloud-vision, azure-document-recognition, etc &amp; open-source OCR backends like - tesseract. 
- It supports async processing of docs on various kinds of cloud storage like s3, GCS, azure storage, etc.
- Due to the abstraction of various types of these cloud/open-source OCR parser backends &amp; storage backends - if required you can just switch from one ocr vendor to the other without any changes to the codebase or the output formats.
- You can also index and search over the parsed docs - currently we support indexing it to Elastisearch and OpenSearch backends. 
- In case you are interested in processing different types of docs with different types of parsers you can automatically identify the type of the doc and then use the appropriate parser (or write your own custom parser) - this is useful if you want to for instance use some deep learning model for handwritten docs or say table extraction etc.. vs using off-the-shelf OCR for regular docs. 
- Document type classification and layout parsing within the docs is built on top of Huggingface transformers - as such you can easily swap out and play with different types of models or add your own custom models into the pipeline as well.","A Python Library to OCR, Archive, Index and Search any documents with ease.",datascience

"**Background**

* I'm finishing up my Master's in Environmental Health and Safety/Industrial Hygiene and have lost all interest in pursuing jobs within that realm (I also have a B.S. in Environmental Sciences). 
* My graduate research primarily relates to developing inexpensive environmental sensing units and conducting multi-month monitoring studies in various classroom type settings

**Relevant Skills/Experience**

* Developing these sensor systems/analyzing the 6+ gigabytes of data I've collected has me using R/Python/SQL/Linux, and various dashboard programs. I don't consider myself a ""pro"" in any of these areas but I haven't run into a problem I couldn't solve utilizing them. 
* I've grown to really really really enjoy working with these types of tools and want to get paid to do it. 
* I also have about 2 years at an environmental consulting company (part-time) working with Access/Excel/GIS/environmental related litigation. 

**My Issues**

* I've only taken 2 stats courses and Calculus (quite a while ago). I do not consider myself good at math
* I'm not familiar with really any ""formal"" data science concepts (Modeling, Error detection and correction)
* I feel like an idiot. I've landed 2 data science related job interviews (Environmental analyst related roles) and couldn't answer basic questions regarding things like water modeling/air quality modeling


Overall, I feel as if I can ""operate the machine"" (use the tools required to work in this field), but not ""make the machine do anything productive"" (conduct complex analysis that derives anything meaningful to a company). The work I've done with the data I've collected for my thesis has been adequate but it's by no means ground breaking:

* Various time-series analysis for determining sensor correlations/relationships between things like: indoor and outdoor air quality, classroom occupancy, HEPA filter operation
* decay curve analysis, basic summary stats
* interfacing with sensors via python, ""hacking""/interfacing with Bluetooth HEPA filters/IR based Air Conditiong units
* Very basic python gui development (Tk)
* basic database design/data base querying (SQL, Influx)

I am building a data pipeline/scheduling solution that runs a complete pipeline only with SQL files, kinda similar to dbt. It can also run Python models.

- The whole pipeline is built from SQL files, no additional code for scheduling at all.
- It can also run Python, in the same pipeline as the SQL assets.
- Pipelines are stored in Git repositories belonging to you, any provider is fine.
- Based on the concept of assets, and allows focusing on business logic.
- It has automated SQL tests for assets; e.g. the order_id column must be unique and not-null, the status column must contain values ""preparing"", ""shipped"" or ""refunded"".
- It can be triggered automatically based on the existence of various files/tables/partitions/query results
    - e.g. Start the pipeline only when the export in S3 is ready
- Runs on a fully managed infra 
- It has the ability to conditionally run tasks, e.g. ""run this task only on Sundays"". 
- It allows you to mix and match dependencies between any task
- It has a UI to manage tasks, logs and pipelines
- No setup/installation is needed to get started, just a text editor

"This query was first put forth on r/econometrics. Posting here to get a more generalized POV on the problem at hand.

Novice forecaster here. I have a time series with daily agri commodity prices. I need to predict prices for at least a month forward. As is with agri commodities, it exhibits seasonality (annual). Based on my research so far, I've heard that SARIMA should do the trick. However, I've heard and seen conflicting information on the forecasting horizon, i.e. the number of time steps in the future you can predict for using the model. One school of though suggests that there is no such limit to the forecast horizon. This mostly comes from textbooks and YouTube tutorials trying to teach SARIMA and/or the ARIMA class of models. The other one suggests that for long forecast horizons, it is best if you take to a recursive approach to predict future values. For example, say the model spec you have picked is SARIMA(2,1,2)(2,1,2)365, then you first forecast the next 2 time steps, then consider the entire series, including the two forecast points in the model and predict again. You do this till you've covered your expected forecast horizon.

I was leaning more to the second method, as it provides a good reason as to why such an approach is necessary: larger the forecast horizon, more likely the predictions would settle at the mean. This is something I did see while using exponential smoothing methods, so it just made sense. That said, I'm also seeing it in my implementation of a recursive SARIMA, which was said to account for this exact same thing! I'd like to believe it's due to some error in my code, but I'd like to cover all my bases. 

Could someone please clarify this for me? Is there any theoretical basis for using the recursive approach, over the other? Also, I'm open to recommendations for other methods that might give me better forecasts, in your opinion. Thanks in advance.

I apologize if the question sounds dumb but i cannot wrap my head around it.

I am trying to generate a synthetic dataset for a project involving the development of an algorithm for an app. There are some delays in the delivery of the software itself and I am trying to start the development prior to having my data.

The app provides readings from various performances during a game (e.g. number of errors, time duration and so on).

These variables collected from the app should fall within certain ranges and should change with the age of the user. This changes should follow a polynomial regression distribution.

Is there a way to populate my dataset with random data that are consistent with this kind of function?

as an example: 

If a variable ranges from 0 to 50, is there a way to simulate that the distribution of my data follows the polynomial distribution ?

Hello everyone, I'm sorry if this is not the right place for this question. I have been looking for the best subreddit to post this under in hopes of some help, so please point me in the right direction if this isn't the appropriate place.

I'm a PhD candidate working on my dissertation. I've been stuck for about a month on a particular data problem, and I cannot figure it out on my own. I've been trying to contact the statistical support team available to graduate students at my university, and I keep getting ignored (currently CCing everyone in the department to see if it helps). I've found some answers through academic articles and some youtube videos, but it leads me to a second problem.

Part 1. I work with SPSS. I'm working with count data that is under-dispersed. The mean is larger than the variance (M 1.64 &amp; V 1.46). Data do not follow a Poisson distribution (underdispersion). Poisson regression cannot be used as it requires equidispersion (mean and variance are equal), and negative binomial regression is only appropriate for overdispersion.

Part 2. Academic articles tell me that the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution and Generalized Poisson regression can be used with under-dispersed count data, but I cannot find information anywhere about how to do this using SPSS.

Does anyone know (or can point me to any sources) how to address underdispersion using SPSS?

Is there a cutoff point for underdispersion? The difference between my mean and variance is very small (M 1.64 &amp; V 1.46). Would it be appropriate to use Poisson regression with these data?

2. perform basic data cleaning (fillna replace etc)
3. perform exploratory analysis
4. perform one hot encoding for categorical variables

Hi everyone! After reading the rules I saw that this sub isn’t a “homework helper”; however I’m not asking that anybody does the project itself for me (as I’m genuinely interested in learning and doing it myself), so here’s to hoping it stays up!

So I have this term project coming up for an econometrics class, and as we've just started to learn R, we must set up some multi-regression analysis on a topic of our choosing. As a basketball fan, I chose to focus on the Lakers' notoriously terrible season this year. For context to those who may not follow the NBA, the Lakers were essentially expected to be one of the top contenders for the championship this year; however, they didn't even make the playoffs. As with anything else, people were quick to point fingers, and a great load of them aimed at Russell Westbrook. In short, I want to find a way to prove, or at least suggest otherwise, that Russ isn't the problem (or the only problem). 

My original idea consisted of taking the roster's 6-7 most active players' performances (pts, reb, ast, minutes, etc.) along with other factors such as whether it was a home or away game as my IV's; and setting my DV as whether they won or not. I changed it slightly though as I don't know whether or not using a dummy variable as my DV would be a good idea or not, so instead I was thinking of maybe taking the win/loss margin of games to numerically categorize wins and losses?

So my issue here now is coming up with a way to model this so that I may start collecting the relevant data. Any and all help is greatly appreciated! And I'm still relatively new to R and programming in general so please bear with me in case I get lost in some of the lingo lol

And if anybody has suggestions on particular data to download or anything please let me know!

"This topic has been on my mind lately as I weigh the pros/cons of leaving my current team (nice people, good learning opportunities along with other less interesting responsibilities) vs joining a new but completely unknown team. Team culture is just as important as the role &amp; responsibilities for me, and the former is almost an after thought in most hiring pipelines. 

Speaking to the hiring manager sure helps, but insufficient to understand the team environment, teammates, working styles, collaboration level, work-life balance etc..

I feel culture fit is usually 1-way assessment with the company judging the candidate, but the candidate has no idea until he/she joins the team (in most cases).

They tell you if a number is up or down or high or low and they just stop there -- and if the stakeholder says the model doesn't match their gut, they just roll their eyes and call them ignorant. The people with a varied background make sure their model churns out something an Executive can read, understand, and make decisions off of, and they have an infinitely better understanding of what is and isn't helpful for their stakeholders.

\&gt;90% of the ML models I've seen weren't even good enough to justify any kind of complex automation. The stupidest models are the clustering ones, the same old k-means fitted 30 times to match with the business knowledge about the client. After 2 years, the models becomes completely useless.

I feel that the industry overcomplicates ML engineering. 

I know plenty of companies unwilling to do extensive smart A/B tests to gain actionable insights, but where DS models ""need"" plenty of DE work. 

Most of today's models are 1% better than 3-5 years ago, but they ""need"" much more care, tools, automatization, maintenance, monitoring etc.

"So I was just zombie scrolling LinkedIn and a colleague reshared a post by a LinkedIn influencer (yeah yeah I know, why am I bothering...) and it went something like this:

&gt; People use this image &lt;insert mocking meme here&gt; to explain doing machine learning (or data science) without statistics or math.

&gt;Don't get discouraged by it. There's always people wanting to feel superior and the need to advertise it. You don't need to know math or statistics to do #datascience or #machinelearning. Does it help? Yes of course. Just like knowing C can help you understand programming languages but isn't a requirement to build applications with #Python

Now, the bit that concerned me was several hundred people commented along the lines of ""yes, thank you influencer I've been put down by maths/stats people before, you've encouraged me to continue my journey as a data scientist"".  

For the record, we can argue what is meant by a 'data science' job (as 90% of most consist mainly of requirements gathering and data wrangling) or where and how you apply machine learning. But I'm specifically referencing a job where a significant amount of time is spent building a detailed statistical/ML model. 
 
Like, my gut feeling is to shoutout ""this is wrong"" but it's got me wondering, is there any truth to this standpoint? I feel like ultimately it's a loaded question and it depends on the specifics for each of the tonnes of stat/ML modelling roles out there. Put more generally: On one hand, a lot of the actual maths is abstracted away by packages and a decent chunk of the application of inferential stats boils down to heuristic checks of test results. But I mean, on the other hand, how competently can you *analyse* those results if you decide that you're not going to invest in the maths/stats theory as part of your skillset? 

I feel like if I were to interview a candidate that wasn't comfortable with the mats/stats theory I wouldn't be confident in their abilities to build effective models within my team. *You're trying to build a career in mathematical/statistical modelling without having learnt or wanting to learn about the mathematical or statistical models themselves?* is a summary of how I'm feeling about this. 

What's your experience and opinion of people with limited math/stat skills in the field - do you think there is an air of ""snobbery"" and its importance is overstated or do you think that's just an outright dealbreaker?","Folks, am I crazy in thinking that a person that doesn't have a solid stat/math background should *not* be a data scientist?",datascience

So I'm looking for ideas and insights on how to model and represent.

My current thought is to create a JSON file with nodes and links. Each node is a data objects and the link describes the link between the two, how strong the link is and the fields where the links occur.

"So I took up a research assistant position a couple months ago at my university and I have been shocked with how little communication there is from my supervisors. I get my assignments by voice from zoom calls which by the way, I have hearing impairment, so hearing is hard, and the supervisors are from India so there's an accent barrier. 

When it comes to email, I am lucky to get a response from them, even if I ask them direct questions concerning the data or if there's more I need to do or just clarification on my assignments. It's gotten so bad that I am literally getting information on my assignments from another assistant who is with me in the project. One time I asked a question asking on the status of the upcoming data and asked if there was more I could do since I \*thought\* I ran out of tasks at hand, and I got no response, but guess what? HE SAID HE GOT MY MESSAGE WHEN WE HAD A ZOOM MEETING A WEEK LATER. AND EVEN BETTER I APPARENTLY COULD HAVE DONE MORE. HOLY SHIT IS IT HARD TO RESPOND TO AN EMAIL? 

When it comes to me doing my job I get basically no feedback. I sunk in hours of work and showed them my progress a few times and THEN THEY DECIDE TO FINALLY TELL ME I HAVE BEEN DOING IT WRONG SO I HAD TO START FROM SQUARE 0.

I have tried to reach out to them to set up a way to communicate better with me BUT THEY NEVER RESPOND TO MY FUCKING EMAILS.

I believe this calls for a fuzzy match?  Redshift has support for user defined functions, including Python, and including SciPy. I've never used SciPy and maybe it could help but I have no idea. 

I see fuzzy wuzzy is a common Python solution; that means I'd have to manually package it and add it to Redshift.

I’ve been contacted by countless recruiters in the past that seem so generic, so my initial thought is to not think too much of it. But, it’s never been from a big-tech company such as Google, so of course it’ll raise an eyebrow. I also kind of always figured companies like Google don’t reach out to people as they get so many applicants anyway. I am not actively seeking other jobs, my LinkedIn profile is not set to “open for work”, and I haven’t applied for a Google position in maybe ~5 years. So my wife thinks this is a really big deal, as they’ve sort of “sniped” me since this was out of the blue.

Obviously I’m not the first nor the last person that’s been contacted by them, so can anyone comment on if this is common? Should I bother spending a lot of energy preparing even though I’m not actively seeking new employment (I would consider this if it was actually pretty serious)?

edit to include a response:

  @ [AnnualCalm347](https://www.reddit.com/user/AnnualCalm347) was kind enough to share :)

At the time, engineering/comp sci internships/co-ops were paid between $21-$29/hr, 37.5hrs a week. The majority of students were offered $24, some students with no prior work experience were offered less, a handful of students with more work experience were offered $25 and higher. The $29 rate I had seen was a single student from Toronto so take that with a grain of salt.

From what I understand the hourly rate was determined ahead of time with HR, I had not heard of a co-op succesfully negotiating a higher rate. I think Telus will decide on the number based on your prior co-op experience, but this is just a guess from my conversations with other co-ops.

If anyone reading this is curious about new grad engineering compensation ([https://www.telus.com/en/about/careers/graduate-technology-leadership-program](https://www.telus.com/en/about/careers/graduate-technology-leadership-program)), in 2020 it was $72 000 with benefits. The starting rate may have changed since then and I don't remember the exact band but over the 3 year program you could expect to get raises (performance based) increasing the compensation up to \~$80 000. After 3 years in the new grad program, successful conversion to a senior, full-time position would place you in a band with a maximum salary of \~$90 000.",Telus Canada internship compensation,datascience

Most are either too high level or compensation is much lower than what I currently make. For reference, I have a BS and MS in chemical engineering and my MS was focused on computational chemistry.

When I joined my company, the team was me and one other senior person. I found out at the end of onboarding that the senior DS would be leaving for a new role, which meant I was the sole DS. My boss has been really chill, but we haven’t filled the role since and our current plan is to bring in another senior DS from our parent company for a short duration.

I had a recruiter contact me today about a senior role that would pay 30% more than my current comp on a much larger team. I’m debating whether to passively interview or really try for this role. The main reasons I would consider leaving is the compensation and larger team. I feel like as the sole DS at my current company, learning has been incredibly difficult. Granted, since no one is here to hold my hand, it has really forced me to self teach a lot. The new job wouldn’t require relocation, but they do want people in office 1x per week whereas I am fully remote at my current role. The commute is really short so I wouldn’t be totally opposed. The factors holding me back is that I currently have a lot of autonomy and the position I would leave the team in. My boss is not technical so me leaving effectively leaves the DS team vacant. 

If you were in my position would you seriously entertain recruiters/offers or passively interview and accumulate more experience?",Leaving Jr. role after a few months,datascience

"Hi everybody! 

I am currently a Junior Data Engineer. I worked in a small consulting firm (\~500 employees) and am currently working in a much bigger company (+100 000 employees), and I faced the same problem in both companies : 

Both of the companies wanted me to build them a data documentation, so that they understand their data (for various usages, mainly building decision-making tools and machine learning). 

The problem that I faced, and still face today, is that I feel like there are no “standards”, still I think that the documentation could be quite the same for every data architecture. However, after some reaseachs, I decided to document my datas using a Data Catalog, a Data Dictionnary, a Flowchart, and a Data Model (this one was obvious and easy). I had a really hard time figuring out what to document and how to document it, so my questions are the following : 

* Did I miss something? I mean, is there an institution that has officialised a way to document data, for universality?
* Is there a popular way to do it?

Y is a top global oil company, locating at a Midwest city close to Chicago (40 min ride). Low living expenditure 850-1300 for rent. Team is white male predominant(I’m a minority). I have to stay at the position for at least two years to transfer to another division like ds or finance.  Pay is 15k higher than X.

"Hey all

Does anyone have experience transitioning DS roles to an entirely new field / domain?  How did you cope with the transition?

For context, I did my PhD in BME, w/ a focus on image processing and computer vision in medical brain imaging.  I had a short part-time role (~11 months) at a biotech startup that overlapped w/ the tail end of my degree and for a few months afterwards.  This role dealt with different types of data but still involved analyses of imaging of various kinds (microscopy).  

Recently (2 weeks ago), I started a FTE DS role at a larger mid-size biotech company.  This role is focused on therapeutic protein design.   I took the role because of the societal value of their work (make drugs cheaper/more accessible), and I wanted to learn about DS as it relates to biologics and manufacturing.  However, beyond basic bio/chem classes and general familiarity with the domain by proximal exposure during my PhD, I don't have direct experience in this field.  During the interviews for this role, I had expressed nervousness / concern that lack of domain knowledge might hinder me, but the company was adamant that my prior skills / expertise would be very useful for their work.

I'm 2 weeks in and feeling pretty overwhelmed by the novelty of the domain.  It feels like I'm learning an entirely new science.  I knew it'd be tough, but I'm starting to feel nervous that I bit off more than I could chew.

Has anyone been in a similar situation, even outside of biotech?  I value the idea of always learning, but I feel like I'm drowning a bit.  One of the more valuable skills I thought I picked up during my PhD was adaptability / resilience in face of new knowledge, but now I'm starting to question the extent of that skill.

I'm usually lurking, but feeling pretty overwhelmed at work currently.

I have a bachelor of Stats and am tasked with the more data-sciencey projects (Yay!)

What's overwhelming are expectations though. I've been working on this clustering (of products) for, perhaps a day and a half now worth of hours, and I feel like I'm being extremely slow - I've found some cul-de-sacs and working on a solution, ~~but I'm feeling my boss becoming a little agitated with the lack of ""concrete"" results.~~  Edit2: Overexcited moreso than ""impatient"" or ""agitated"" should have been the word to use.

Edit: Thanks for the multiple replies! Sounds like we are indeed moving very fast and that I need to communicate my efforts a little better.

"Hello everyone! Thanks in advance for reading and/or replying.

Here's the thing, our pipeline (only structured data) involves:

1) An outlier detection process.

2) Some other stuff.

3) Model training (with hyper-parameters selection).

4) More ""other stuff and optimizations"".

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently introducing new features to the model, so it's time to implement a feature selection step. We decided to go with Boruta algorithm (we use an XGBoost model as feature selector, which is the core of our final model) given that it does not require to train the productive model several times (we train it weekly) and it even performed better than recursive methods. The approaches on the table are:

1) Implement Boruta right before training the model.

Pros: straightforward into the pipeline + infrastructure simplicity.

Cons: we may've removed rows on the outlier processing step due to values on variables that will not be considered into the final model. The data is not abundant. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) Perform Boruta before outlier processing.

Pros: keep all the rows that are not outliers on the important variables (more data to train).

Cons: outliers may alter Boruta's output.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Perform Boruta after step 2 and with those final features re-run from step 1.

Pros: keep all the rows that are not outliers on the important variables (more data to train)

Cons: more time-consuming and not straightforward to implement.

&amp;#x200B;

We decided to go with option 1 for the moment.

"I'm hoping someone here can tell me what it is like to work as a data scientist at a strategy consulting firm, e.g. McKinsey or BCG.

I'm asking because in the past month, a few recruiters from these firms have reached out to me, but, in my mind, data science/machine learning and strategy consulting are more or less polar opposites. 

Strategy consulting tries to (you guessed it) answer strategic questions. Should we branch out to market X or geographic location Y? Is a merger with company Z beneficial? These problems are wholly unfit for a machine learning approach. Machine learning is good at solving problems that are very operational. Can we predict what products a prospective client is most interested in? Can we match a face on a webcam with an ID so that people don't have to visit a branch to open an account? You take a very small part of a business process and make it better and/or more efficient. Completely different from the 'in what direction should we take the company' kind of questions a strategy consultant deals with. Sure, you can strategically decide to use data science in your company, but that in itself is not a data science question.

Yes, I did pull a little sneaky on ya here by equating data science and machine learning. There's 1000 different definitions of what 'data science' is, but in my mind ML is an essential part of it. Otherwise you're doing data analysis or something else entirely.

I could understand a data analysis and/or process mining role in such an environment, marketed as data science to attract a certain kind of talent. I suspect that's probably what's going on here. But actual data science? I don't really see how that would work

I might be completely wrong here because I'm assuming a ton of stuff about companies that I haven't seen from the inside. I'd be interested to hear that as well, if that's the case. Thanks for any insight you can offer!",Data Science at strategy consultants,datascience

If so, would sampling 8000 1s and 8000, 0s do the trick?

Combine all of that info only if that user is NOT in a security group.**

1. use provided json file (flat structure non-nested with string and boolean)
2. If the boolean is false, then I need to grab the username and match it to the CSV file username
3. When JSON and CSV usernames are matched, I then need to combine the JSON object data with the CSV row data, and write it to a new CSV file..  (JSON doesnt have manager and email, but the CSV does.. and the new CSV needs everything)
4. Extra Credit probably: be mindful of duplicates and names spelled wrong, and probably mention somewhere in the output.
5. Do this in both powershell and python, with out using additional packages (no Pandas)

About me: Besides the sysadmin/network experience over the last 8 years, I've done some web full-stack with flask and other tools. Used a lot of APIs and python for networking, a lot of powershell for automating tasks like installs, inventory, and report gathering while outputting to CSV.

tl;drAm I wrong for thinking that the employer is asking for too much while only offering up to $80k? This assignment feels way out of scope to me, can I get some oppinions from you data science peeps please?  


EDIT: Thanks for the comments. I only provided myself two hours to do the assignment and I decided not to submit the halfworking script. I explained to the recruiter in a polite way that the respsonsibilities listed in the description did not correspond to the assignment and the pay scale.

Say a company provides online service and wants to predict  the probability of a user renewing their subscription throughout their tenure, what’s the best way to describe the events that are happened before they renew? For example, customers might submit several surveys during the year of subscription and each survey has a score. I’m currently thinking of aggregating the surveys on the user level by extracting some useful information such as average score, max score, min score, first score, last score etc. However, what I’ll lose is the time series of the sentiments over time and survey comments texts that can be analyzed too.

"Hi everyone,

I am about to take an important decision, and I would love to learn from your experiences.

I am an M.Res. in Economics graduate with less than two years of experience. Currently, I am working for a technology start-up that deals with geospatial data. I am the data science manager/lead (it happens pretty quickly, I know :) ). The team consists of an engineer, a data scientist (who deals with deep learning), me, and several data analysts.

***Pros:***

* The company grows (very) fast. I have a stock option.
* My team is producing one of the core products.
* I am directly working with the co-founders, and we have a great relationship.
* I have time to improve myself.
* Remote and flexible working hours.

***Cons:***

* I do not have supervision.
* Although we are responsible for one of the essential products, the way we do it is (very) immature. The batch processes are done manually, and we cannot utilize data science fully because of technical limitations.
* I am the only one with a strong data science background including econometrics and statistics. The deep learning guy is great in his field but only focuses on neural networks.
* There is confusion about data science and geospatial data operations.

For the last couple of months, I have spent my time on two things. The first is an architecture design that allows us to utilize data science much better (including where to get data, how to store, it etc.). Second, showing how utilizing data science better improves our predictions. Also, I am planning to expand the science team, and separate it from the operations team. However, I cannot create the whole architecture just by myself, and our data engineer is leaving.

As a result, I am in two minds: feeling great vs. losing my time. Feeling great because not in many companies, you can increase prediction accuracy from 80% to 90% by researching NASA presentations. Losing my time because according to the Google MLOps paper, we almost fail every checkpoint, at the initial stage of my career I should learn the best practices and the state of art.

Recently, I wanted to test myself in the market. I can move to the HFT industry, thanks to my quantitative background. The wage and bonuses will be higher, but there will be no stock option. The team is more mature, and there will be supervision. However, the environment will be more stressful, and the working hours will be longer. Finally, the data science in the HFT industry is unique/weird. It is much more focused on finding (weak) signals which fail most of the trials.

If you read until this point, thank you very much for your time. Under these conditions, what should I do? What would be your advice?

***Edit 1***: [*u/FizbanFire*](https://www.reddit.com/user/FizbanFire) *asked a very good question related to the future career options in the HFT industry. I expand it and question the future career options in the geospatial data science for an economist.*

***Edit 2***: [*u/Fender6969*](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fender6969) *suggested finding a supervisor. I don't know how to find one. However, we have an advisor with an industrial engineering Ph.D. from top schools who is an optimization expert. I will discuss if he can help me.*

"# Background:

In August 2021, I walked away from a systems administrator job to start a data science transition/journey.  At the time, I gave myself 18 months to make the transition-- starting with a three month DS boot camp (Sept 2021 - Dec 2021), followed by a six month algorithmic trading course (Jan 2022 - Jun 2022), and ending with a 10 month master’s program (May 2022 - Mar 2023).   The algo trading course is a personal hobby.

# Pre-work:

General Assembly requires all student to complete the pre-work one week before the start date.  This is to ensure that students can ""*hit the ground running.*""  In my opinion, the pre-work doesn’t enable students to hit the ground running.  Several dropped out despite completing the pre-work. I encountered strong headwinds in the course.  I found the pre-work to be superficial, at best.

The Pre-work consists of the following:

&amp;#x200B;

[Pre-work modules](https://preview.redd.it/xou0f70n80u81.jpg?width=1197&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddae989e23f33a7a4024c4acd24b4f18b328588b)

# Pre-Assessment:

After completion of the pre-work, there is an assessment.

&amp;#x200B;

[Assessment](https://preview.redd.it/bbk31j2y80u81.jpg?width=837&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97593417d346eb5aac3d3b1e4f097e02c730999b)

The assessment was accurate in predicting my performance (especially the applied math section).  I didn’t have any problems with the programming and tools parts of the boot camp.

My pain points were grasping the linear algebra and statistics concepts.  Although I had both classes during my undergraduate studies, it’s as if I didn’t take them at all, because I took those classes over 20 years ago, and hadn’t done any professional work requiring knowledge of either.

I had to spend extra time to regain the sheer basics, amid a time-compressed environment where assignments, labs, and projects seem to be relentless.

# Cohort:

The cohort started with 14 students and ended with nine.  One of the dropouts ***wasn’t a true dropout***.  He’s a university math professor, who found a data science job, one week into the boot camp.  I always wondered why he enrolled, given his background.  He said he just wanted the hands-on experience.  At $15,000, that's a pricey endeavor just to get some hands-on experience.

The students had the following background:

&amp;#x200B;

* An IT systems administrator (me)
* A PhD graduate in nuclear physics
* Two economists (BA in Economics)
* A linguist (BA in Linguistics, MA in Education)
* A recent mechanical engineering graduate (BSME)
* A recent computer science graduate (BSCS)
* An accounting clerk (BA in Economics)
* A program developer (BA in Philosophy)
* A PhD graduate in mathematics (***dropped out*** to accept a DS job)
* An eCommerce entrepreneur (BA Accounting and Finance, ***dropped out*** of program)
* An electronics engineer (BS in Electronics and Communications Engineering, ***dropped out*** of program)
* A self-employed caretaker of special needs kids (BA Psychology, ***dropped out*** of program)
* A nuclear reactor operator (***dropped out*** of program)

# Instructors:

The lead instructor of my cohort is very smart and could teach complex concepts to new students.  Unfortunately, she left after four weeks into the program, to take a job with a startup.  The other instructors were competent, and covered down well, after her departure.  However, I noticed a slight drop off in pedagogy.

# Format:

The course length was 13 weeks, five days a week, and eight hours a day, with an extra 4 - 8 hours a day outside of class.

Two labs were due every week.

We had a project due every other week, culminating with a capstone project, totaling seven projects.

Blog posts are required.

Tuesdays were half-days-- mornings were for lectures, and afternoons were dedicated to Outcomes.  The Outcomes section was comprised of lectures that were employment-centric.  Lectures included how to write a resume, how to tweak your Linked-In profile, salary negotiations, and other topics that you would expect a career counselor to present.

# Curriculum:

**Week 1 - Getting Started: Python for Data Science:** Lots of practice writing Python functions.  The week was pretty straight-forward.

**Week 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis:** Descriptive and inferential stats, Excel, continuous distributions, etc. The week was straight-forward, but I needed to devote extra time to understanding statistical terms.

**Week 3 - Regression and Modeling:** Linear regression, regression metrics, feature engineering, and model workflow.  The week was a little strenuous.

**Week 4 - Classification Models:** KNN, regularization, pipelines, gridsearch, OOP programming and metrics. The week was very strenuous week for me.

**Week 5 - Webscraping and NLP:** HTML, BeautifulSoup, NLP, Vader/sentiment analysis. This week was a breather for me.

**Week 6 - Advanced Supervised Learning:** Decision trees, random forest, boosting, SVM, bootstrapping.  This was another strenuous week.

**Week 7 - Neural Networks:** Deep learning, CNNs, Keras. This was, yet, another strenuous week.

**Week 8 - Unsupervised Learning:** KMeans, recommender systems, word vectors, RNN, DBSCAN, Transfer Learning, PCA.  **For me, this was the most difficult week of the entire course**.  PCA threw me for a loop, because I forgot the linear algebra concepts of eigenvectors and eigenvalues.  I’m sucking wind at this point.  I’m retaining very little.

**Week 9 - DS Topics:** OOP, Benford’s Law, imbalanced data.  This week was less strenuous than the previous week.  Nevertheless, I’m burned out.

**Week 10 - Time Series:** Arima, Sarimax, AWS, and Prophet.  I’m burned out. Augmented Dickey, what?  p-value, what?  Reject what?  What’s the null hypothesis, again?

**Week 11 - SQL &amp; Spark:** SQL cram session, and PySpark.  Okay, I remember SQL.  However, formulating complex queries is a challenge.  I can’t wait for this to end.  The end is nigh!

**Week 12 - Bayesian Statistics:** Intro to Bayes, Bayes Inference, PySpark, and work on capstone project.

**Week 13 - Capstone:** This was **the easiest week** of the entire course, because, from Day 1, I knew what topic I wanted to explore, and had been researching it during the entire course.

# My Thoughts:

The pace is way too fast for persons who lack an academically rigorous background and are new to data science.  If you are considering a three-month boot camp, keep that in mind.   Further, you may want to consider GA’s six month flex option.

Despite the pace, I retained some concepts.  Presently, I am going through an algo trading course where data science tools and techniques are heavily emphasized.  The concepts are clearer now.  Had I not attended General Assembly, I would be struggling.

Further, I anticipate that when I begin my master’s in data science , it will be less strenuous as a result of attending GA’s boot camp.

**At $15,000**, if I had to pay this out of my own pocket, I doubt I would have attended.   With that price tag, one should consider getting a master’s in data science, instead of going the boot camp route.  In some cases, it’s cheaper and you’ll get more mileage.  That's just my opinion.  I could be wrong.

The program should place more emphasis on **storytelling** by offering a week on **Tableau**.  Also, more time should have been spent on SQL.  Tableau and more SQL will better prepare more students for more realistic roles such as Data Analyst or Business Analyst.  In my opinion, those blocks of instruction can replace Spark and AWS blocks.

**Have a plan.**  You should know why you want to attend a DS boot camp and what you hope to get out of it.  When I enrolled, I knew attending GA was a small, albeit intensive, stepping stone.  I had no plan to conduct a job search upon completion, because I knew I had gaps in my background that a three-month boot camp could not resolve.  More time is needed.

Prepare to be unemployed for a long time (six to 12 months), because a boot camp is just an intensive overview.   Many people don’t have the academic rigor in their background to be “data science ready” *(i.e., step into a DS role)* after a 12 week boot camp.",General Assembly Data Science Immersive (Boot Camp) Review,datascience
"Hypothetical scenario: there is an imaginary medium/big mature company that sells a certain product or service. This company have all it's invoices, other basic data (such as customer profiles) gathered and some other important KPIs measured, but does not use this data to become a data driven company or to take any kind of decision based on data whatsoever.

+ Cross-sell and up-sell clients clusterization (in order to direct marketing campains and vendors)

"Hi all,

I am quite new to data science and have started to create my own projects to better get to grips with data science on a practical level, however have come across a hurdle. My current project looks at Tweets regarding a company compared to the current stock market price of the same company, my data frame consists of a list of dates, a check column which is Boolean type with either True or False (True meaning there was a tweet regarding the company that day) and the stock market price for the day. Initially I ran a pointbiserialr test in Python from the Scipy package and this has returned significant p value, however I am not familiar with this test and I am somewhat unsure if this actually measures what I am looking for. My understanding is that this suggests that on the day a tweet occurs the stock price is statistically different on average than when there is no tweet, however I may be wrong in this understanding. Upon reconsideration I think an ANOVA test may be better suited where I group the stock price into 4 categories - one for where tweets are made back to back days, one where there are no tweets for back to back days, one for when there was a tweet the day prior and not one the day of, and one where there wasn't a tweet the day prior but one on the day off, group those as such and treat them as independent groups and add the percentage change in stock price from the day prior to the day of next to each day in each group and run an ANOVA test. However I am also uncertain if this would be correct. Any advice on what my current test has measured and if an ANOVA test is an appropriate follow up test would be much appreciated, sorry in advance for my lack of statistical test knowledge.

I feel that I lose my focus on my main activity when I'm watching a movie or when I'm listening to music. That led to certain anxiety about losing performance and I'm even finding it difficult to go out to a bar to drink with friends or meet new people because I feel I'll lose my grasp on what's important to me: finding a job in the field after my 6 months bootcamp. 

For the sake of my mental health and my well-being though, I can't put aside every source of pleasure for data science and statistics.

"I work in biotech, and have always used GitHub in the following way: we have a production branch and a development branch. I make feature branches off the development branch to test one feature at a time, then when I feel it’s ready I have a colleague or my boss test it, and then it gets merged to the dev branch. Rinse and repeat. While working, I commit liberally to my feature branch and I generally do a git push at the end of my work day. This is mainly so that a) my boss can see what I’ve done and we can discuss it, and b) it’s safeguarded in case a colleague terminates my AWS instance (did happen once, and this practice saved my ass).

My boss recently told me he only wants me to push fully-finished code to GitHub. So, I should checkout my feature branch, work and commit as needed, but never push it to GitHub until it’s completely finished code.  

All this aside, I actually want to know how is GitHub SUPPOSED to be used? Is either of us right, are both of us wrong, or is this a stylistic choice?  I’m just curious because I’m mostly self-taught. My way just seemed like the logical way to have multiple people collaborating, but no one ever told me that was the way.

"A lot of people here are early in their careers and may not understand who all fits into the hiring process - and how.

So here's a quick primer.

The hiring manager is the person in charge of deciding who ultimately gets hired. 98% of the time, this will be the person who manages the candidate being hired. The hiring manager is responsible for defining what they want in a candidate, what they will be doing, etc. The way they do this is by writing a *job description*, which outlines the skills and experience a person should have as well as what they will be doing.

The HR comp department will then take a job description and grade it, i.e., decide how much someone in that role should be paid. This is the team that says ""if you want someone with 3 years of experience and a grad degree, they should get $Xk a year"".

Then comes your HR business partner. As a hiring manager, you don't normally talk to the comp team directly. Your HR BP is the one who coordinates everything, and they can also be the one to give you insights into how a JD may influence comp. Example, they may tell you ""if you make a grad degree optional, the max they will approve is $100K-$140K, if you want to go higher than that, you'll need to require a grad degree"".

Then there's the recruiter aka talent acquisition. These are the people that find candidates and do the initial screening on them - reading resumes and conducting an initial interview.

Important callout: a data science recruiter likely has no experience with data science. However, if they are good recruiters, they understand what data scientists do *and how they talk about it*. Having said that, they're only screening - they are mostly making sure that what you said you did is legit, and that it generally matches what the hiring manager wants.

Most of the rest of the process is handled by the hiring manager, with HR primarily helping administratively - setting up meetings, sending emails, etc.

HR doesn't make decisions (other than screening and grading). HR is there purely to carry out their process.

Points of conflict between hiring managers and HR:

1. Bad grading: you put together a reasonable job description, and the grading comes $50K under what you expected. Normally this happens when companies use bad comparison points (e.g., to find comparable salaries to DS they use ""IT professionals"", or instead of using data in your high COL city using state-wide data). That can lead to ""job description padding"", when you make the job description much demanding than what you're willing to hire so you can pay what you want. 

2. Bad screenings: your recruiter filters out people because they have a MS in biostats instead of stats, or they just don't know that operations research is a relevant discipline. Or they will let people through that don't have the right experience. 

3. Lazy recruiters: recruiters do two things to find candidates - look at who applied, and actively look for candidates who may be passive. Lazy ones don't do the second part.",Quick Primer: players in the hiring process,datascience

"Compensation-wise: about 30% more than I was being paid before I started. I actually have what most high achieving people would consider, a good job. I was already at a fairly good job before if you’re wondering why only 30% increase.

Future-outlook: A lot better. I certainly feel more respected at work, and more confident in my career. The industry is still at it’s birth, so if you study the right things, there are a lot of opportunities to accomplish what you want compared to most fields/industries.

Advice for beginners: the first 3-6 months are the hardest. You’re really new in the space, opportunities will not come easily then. Just keep LEARNING. Consider applying to other jobs that are easier to get but have the opportunities to interact with data people. Like internships, data entry jobs, volunteer work, etc. Heck, I’ve interacted frequently at work with people from customer support, sales, product management, etc. whom we were able to get setup with their own data environment because they were interested in learning and pulling the data they need. If you’re not sure where to start, there are great blogs, quora posts, cheap online platforms, etc. It may seem like an endless amount of information, but I’ve found that most information is useful and can lead you to other information.","I started self learning data science 2 years ago, and this where I’ve gotten.

"I have a (maybe naive) question regarding the predictive quality of a given ML regression algorithm:

Can you take the standard deviation of the difference

from your testing data and use it to turn your predicted number into a range?

Say you predict the material property of a new compound based on your trained algorithm. You get a predicted value and you get the standard deviation from your testing data:

    value = 500
    sigma = 8

Could you give your result as:

    value +- 3 sigma 
    [476 .. 524]

and claim that based on the available data you have a 99.7% probability of the compound property being in this range?

Is this meaningful? Are there problems with this thinking? Am I missing something? This feels too simplistic and my gut tells me that there probably are issues with it but I can't put my finger on what it is exactly. I'd appreciate any pointers you could give me. 🙂

"First time working with non technical manager whose domain is industry knowledge and not data/statistics. Most days they know what they don’t know, but sometimes they want to drive some analysis in questionable ways to me.

For example, they asked that I remove 20%+ of the random sampled data so that we could build a perfectly smooth curve fit for only &lt;80% of the data. By eyeballing the visuals. I explained to them that these data points, though not fitting well visually on their “ideal” curve where the majority of the dats is, are not definitionally outliers. They were randomly sampled by our chief DS, there was no data entry errors and they belong to our target population. By removing them we make the data seem more predictable than it actually is, and invalidates conclusions. To no avail.

In similar veins, another time they asked for another “perfect” curve based only on averaged data, which removes all variability in our raw data. I found a post describing exactly what they wanted to do [here -  they want to do chart #2 instead of #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/d5w6ht/linear_regression_all_data_vs_averaged_data/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) - which explains consequences of doing so (“Ecological fallacy”). I ran both analyses, showed them that the first approach generates a curve that is closer to what chief DS expects. But they say the curve through all individual data points must surely be skewed by the 20% of data points that don’t fit the curve as perfectly/closely. 

I have &lt;5 years of experience, top undergrad in Econometrics and am completing my Master’s in DS. They have 30+ in industry. I’m within my first year working with them so I’m at a loss of what to do.

For more context: I’m junior, so my model isn’t the primary moneymaker here. We produce one out of many inputs that go into business decisions. I guess in that sense, their approaches don’t automatically endanger the business, their or my job. But they will present this to upper people at some point. Their priority is to show a clean and easy to understand “model” as the audience is also non technical. Even so, if it’s the way it currently is, I feel that I shouldn’t have my name on it.

Being relatively new to ML, I can’t really see a reason why auto ML isn’t viewed as anything other than a really useful tool. Just from my impression online, it seems most people involved in ML don’t rate it.

Surely being able to test loads of models is a time saving thing? And the ability to tune hyper parameters and cross validate automatically. I personally don’t yet have the ability to tell which model would be most appropriate, so I’ve enjoyed using it and seeing what models work well (I haven’t deployed a model from there yet though)

"I'm developing a weekend workshop marketed to data scientists that want to work or volunteer for environmental causes. My goal is to help data scientists without a background in environmental science or conservation biology learn what databases are out there and, more importantly, how to build connections to find work with non-profits and academic scientists.

I'm a biologist that uses statistics pretty extensively in sustainability and conservation research. I've been impressed with what my friends who went into data science, data engineering, and machine learning can do. There are some ""big questions"" in the world of conservation and the environment. But many research groups simply do not have the skills available to come up with answers, but I'm convinced many data scientists do. Nobody gets rich doing this work, but I can attest its rewarding and fascinating.

I would love some tips on where to market such a workshop. As I said, my target audience is NOT other biologists - I know plenty of those. The workshop would be hybrid and hosted at the border of upstate New York and Connecticut, USA, approximately 1.5 hours from NYC.

I hope this doesn't break the mod rules! I am not doing this for profit, just to help an organization I work with.

"I'm beginning to think that the data science job I want doesn't actually exist...

I've had three roles in in the DS industry and I've come to believe that there are three DS archetypes:

(1) the Researcher; these are the guys/gals who invented Fb Prophet, for example. Their work is all about R&amp;D to bring a tool that could support many, hypothetically infinite downstream problems, and performance on benchmark tasks is emphasized. Without a PhD, it's hard to get considered for these sorts of roles.

(2) the Engineer; these are the folks who seldom invent truly novel models but more often train and deploy established models as a service. They're not inventing the next world-class language model, they're using transfer learning on BERT to build an MLaaS product. I've had these roles before but find them unsatisfying; the answer is almost always 'more data' or 'better hyperparameter tuning' but understanding the inner-mechanics of the model takes a back seat to knowing how to integrate a model into a production environment (CS-heavy, which isn't my background.)

(3) the Statistician; these are the data scientists who are interested in understanding the user-product ecosystem. Their output isn't a deployed model but articulating 'who, what, where, when &amp; why.' Their output is tangible and 'unblocks' executives when a decision needs to be made.

My current role by far is most aligned with the Statistician archetype (DS product analytics at Meta.) My personal interest area is in Bayesian statistics. I find hypothesis testing to be reductionist and view Bayesian methods as holistic models that better answer 'who, what, where, when &amp; why.' Yet, Meta has a very fast-paced, impact-oriented culture.

Sure, I could do regression analysis to infer the interaction of age and gender on product usage. But it's an unspoken rule that I'm discouraged from doing so. It's preferred that I visualize relationships, formulate a hypothesis and generate some confidence intervals, using our experimentation platform. Nobody cares about quantifying the magnitude of the interaction; they're much more binary (significant or not? Decide.) The cadence is so fast that there isn't an appetite for a fully Bayesian approach.

I feel that my dream job might not exist. I'd love to take a real problem, draw up a diagram of relevant variables, define a model in PyMC3 or Stan, use MCMC simulations, and visualize the posterior to better understand 'who, what...'

Any thoughts on this? Do you agree with my archetypes (would you add/remove/modify any?) And any hints on where I might look for the flavor of DS more aligned with my pitch?

I'm very close to saying 'F it. I'm making cash/stocks at a growth company, my dream job isn't worth giving up a good deal.'

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 1: Yes, the data donkey is definitely a relevant archetype. And if I'm honest with myself, my role is some combination of statistician and donkey... currently, pulled more in the donkey direction.

I think this is actually the job I want, as others have noted, it's literally labeled ""statistician"":

"Hello!

This question will likely end up being moved to StackOverflow but for now, I am looking for assistance finding a good R Package for this. And I did spend a long time trying to google for this and I found many results, too many.

I am trying to create a project in R that will allow me to take in my own transaction history using CSVs from Mint and label the merchants from the description. This seems like a simple if statement but it is actually far more complicated for two reasons. First, Some companies (like Target) use a custom description for every transaction ""Central Checkout \[ID\]"". And second, if I go to a brand new store I would like the model to attempt to determine the store from the description (and I can correct it if needed), so I don't have to update the list of potential merchants every time I go somewhere new.

"Hello everyone,

I'm looking for examples where I can see the application of confidence intervals in a business setting.
I'm specifically looking into finding some (Powerpoint) slides on the web that can give me a somewhat realistic insight into how such numbers would be presented by say a data analyst to a non-data person during a meeting.

All theory is grey but examples rock. They help me understand the application.

Alternatively, if there's no (free) slides available, would you share some technical points from your own experience? What kind of data were you talking about, who were you presenting to, what kind of graph/plot did you use and how did you visualise and communicate the confidence intervals?

Many thanks and stay healthy.

"TL;DR: this is the most candidate friendly market I've seen for people with literally any level of actual experience - but the most brutal I've seen for people with no experience. If you have to, make it a priority to get *any* experience - even if non-DS related.

I've been a hiring manager for several roles over the last 4 years. In every case, I was looking for people with some experience - small teams, so I wasn't really in a position to take on a candidate to raise myself - I needed someone who could function pretty independently.

It has been hell. Everyone who has even 1 year of experience as a data scientist is going to be inundated with offers, and now that remote work has fully opened up, even in average COL cities you're fighting companies offering East/West coast salaries. 

On the other hand, every job ad I've put out has been inundated with applications from people with 0 experience.

What does that mean?

* When choosing an academic path, focus on something that will make you stand out - not on the path of least resistance. Example: I see a lot of people go routes like ""I got a BS in humanities, so I don't want to try to get into a MS in Stats because I'd need to cover too many prereqs, so I'm gonna do a bootcamp"". That is the wrong mentality. That will land you in the really long list of candidates that look like that. By contrast, someone with a legit humanities background and a legit MS in Stats will look *a lot* more interesting. 

* Evaluate programs based on how well they place students into jobs. This is especially true for MS in DS programs who normally put a lot more effort into it. Go on LinkedIn and see where their grads go work and in what roles. For example: a lot of programs will send their grads to entry level DS roles at companies where DS = Data Analyst. Which isn't bad - but it's a different baseline than starting out as a legit DS. As an example: I tried to recruit Texas A&amp;M's stats department for MS and PhD students and most of them had offers lined up from FAANGs or NYC ad tech/fin Tech jobs. 

* As soon as you hit the 1 year mark at your job, start applying for your next job. I don't know how long this era will last, but right now companies are desperate to hire and they know they need to pay up to do so. Take advantage of that. This is not the era to sit around and hope your company will give you a raise higher than inflation. Go apply for jobs. 

* If you're not getting call backs and you have either a) a strong academic background (e.g., grad school from top 30 school with research publications), or b) any legit DS experience in a full time job, immediately assume that your resume needs work. Seek help, and not from academics, but from people in industry or professional resume writers. This sub can be helpful too.

EDIT: Two caveats here:

1. This doesn't apply to those on F1 visas. Getting a job on an F1 visa is going to be 10 times harder than if you already have a green card or you're a citizen. No way around that. 

2. If you suspect your resume may be an issue, listen to this podcast episode and look at the sample resume attached. If you want me to help you out, do that step first so we can speak the same language. https://www.manager-tools.com/2005/10/your-resume-stinks

* if you're having trouble landing the DS job you want, find a DS adjacent job and then move into DS in a year. Having even 1 year of real world exoerience will make hiring managers a lot more likely to hire you.",Job Market from a Hiring Manager's point of view,datascience

I am currently switching from software engineering to data science in my company and in fact I am the first to do data science. There is great potential, but...

The Product Owner does not want me to connect to the database in production but instead he wants me to use another database which is used by the finance team to do acoounting and reporting.

Obviously I can not achieve the expected result with that data, because garbage in -&gt; garbage out.

"Hi,

I have a use case: There is a Kafka topic emitting messages continuously, and I want to keep the last X minutes of messages (based on some field timestamp in the schema) in a Pandas data frame, and of course update it as new messages arrive (i.e. by removing older messages). The goal is later to run queries on the data frame using DuckDB.  


Now of course I can simply append new messages to the data frame and remove the old ones using a Pandas filter. But is that efficient/the most efficient one? Is there some way to ""index"" that timestamp field to make things faster? Or even better, keep the data frame ""sorted"" on that field? What do you do for such a use case?  


Please note that the final ""data structure"" needs to be something supported by DuckDB which I believe leaves us esssentially with Pandas only.

"I’ll do my best to provide some context here - I work for a very large performance based call center. My title is not officially Data Analyst but just Analyst. However, based off what I’ve read online, a lot of my tasks are very similar. I am required to understand and execute relatively complex SQL queries, work with Power BI, Excel, and I will soon be asked to work with Python. I started at the bottom of the food chain as someone who made the calls and worked my way up. I don’t have any formal education but have only a few classes left for my associates in computer programming. I do have formal education in databases and Python. A lot of my tasks include but are not limited to:

- Create outbound call/email/text lists with various parameters that have included millions of clients
- Compiling both internal &amp; external call stats for various reports, KPI’s, and associate scorecards
- Integrating and managing internal sites that are utilized by lower level employees for stats &amp; rewards

Some of these tasks are somewhat high risk considering the fact that a lot of places have certain laws against receiving calls during different times, reasons, etc. As well as putting together scorecards for people that make the calls since this will ultimately quantify their performance for managers/supervisors to make decisions on raises &amp; bonuses. So there is very little room for mistakes with some of my tasks. 

My annual salary is about $48k in the Midwest region of the US. I have a total of 4 YoE working for the company, but only a few months in this position with no other experience as an analyst.

But after reading about some peoples jobs &amp; salaries making 6+ figures and working half as much as I do, I’m not so sure.

There has to be a more efficient, effective and economical beneficial process for this, it kind of hit me one day that while there is a PEMDAS for the Order of Operations in algebra, what is there for algorithm choice when doing data science work?

There is PEMDAS for the algebra stuff = 100% efficient ! Since 1898

There is SCIEM for the stats/data stuff = XXX% efficient ? Since 1983

There is CRISP-DM for the MBA-ish stuff = XXX% efficient ? Since 1996

There is My-Process for a smattering of all three = X31% efficient over 6 years

Is there a unified theory for all of this and my initial findings is that there doesn't seem to be a single obvious, nor one that is unified theory for Data Science... yet?

PEMDAS was drilled into me by the schools and this is computationally 100% totalitarian dictator enforced and there are no dissidents allowed.

I walked across SCIEM, which stands for Split test, Misc Cleaning, Impute Missing Values, Encode/Scale, and Modeling the data; Has a locus of for math or algorithmic model for data processing.

Then you have CRISP-DM which is for Business understanding, Data understanding, Data preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, Deployment; Has a locus of process for MBA-ish data management

While I have 6 years working in finance as an advisor we used heavy amounts of analysis to understand the customers goals, risk tolerance, event horizon analysis, and how much time or effort they wanted to put in. We had a heavily defined process that came from regulation and we have millions of case studies showing that this specific process was heavily weighted in success. I mean it was so ridiculously displayed in the data that it was practically newtonian in the reliability, that it looked familiar but I couldn't quite recall where I saw it first. It was so effective that those of us who just followed this process and logged it independently in excel noted a simple wave pattern emerged and the frequency became quite obvious, it was logarithmic.

So when we met clients we had an incredible amount of confidence in our probability of success, so clients frequently said yes. We gathered data, asked a trainload of questions ended that meeting, scheduled the next and went to input data. Subsequently we used heavily modified Monte Carlo and HMM plus a smattering of other algorithms but always there was a process that BlackRock software had us enter the data in. Then we progressed to the next step, check our assertions vs a backtesting application and then go back into optimization in a sort of hybrid efficient frontier.

The output of all this was incredible and I never had one client come back to say they had gotten a better analysis by Schwab, DA Davidson, LPL, Fidelity, Prudential, Vanguard, JP Morgan, Allianz... but the constant outlier that amazed me was Goldman Sachs. Every freaking time they had an additional edge, tweak or an ensemble of things and we almost always had a less effective model in their &gt;$375,000 assets projections.

So I said all of that to show that in some fields they absolutely have found a process, or THE PROCESS and deviating from it was economic suicide or at least a glutton for punishment.

The concern is that for CLV you do not have a ton of data on that specific individual and there are a ton of factors that drive purchase volume such as competition, macro economic forces, and ongoing business changes.

I’ve just begun studying Gaussian Process Regression and Bayesian Linear Regression and, having focused on DL the past 2 years, I began to wonder about applying the Bayesian concepts to the parameters in a neural network (getting joint distributions for each parameter in the network).

Now I imagine Bayesian Networks are limited in practice due to intractable integrals and computation but haven’t gotten this far down the rabbit hole yet. Before I do, has anyone here worked with them? If so, what would be some key points and advice you’d like to give?

This toy dataset shows water consumption values for a single household, with a data-providing water meter attached to the water line. Now, this dataset shows us at different timestamps throughout a day, in chronological order, how much water is being used per each use of water. The ""ID"" column attaches assigns a unique ID to separate each water use event. The ""Value"" column shows a value attributed to the rate of water being used at that timestamp (just made up here). A key assumption this conceptual example relies is that there can only be one water use event at a time.

And so, through python, I group this dataset by ""ID"" and create a separate plot for each ID, as a data subset. And so I have a plot of data showing a curve of water use rate ""Value"" over the course of time duration for each water use event, last anywhere from say 5 minutes to 15 minutes. Now, some of these curves might actually be represent someone washing their hands, or washing produce in the sink, or taking a shower, etc., but we don't actually know! Still, we can hypothesize that each of these types of water use events will be roughly categorized by curves that look similar, when you have a high enough sample size of water use events to analyze. And so first I want to group all like curves/subsets together, such as to say ""hmmm ok these two curves go up a bit, then waaaay up, then flatten out, then go up a bit more, and then shoot down, yeah these two both look like that. And this is waaay different looking than the shape of that other curve, that one must belong to a different group. And so from this I would create this dataframe:

And so my question is, how can I use machine learning or any other data science method to group my data subsets (water use event IDs) by what their corresponding curve looks like?

"In this post, I want to share why I got into data science and use it as a platform to solicit others' stories. It's taken me three roles in the industry to really zero in on why I'm here, but I finally stumbled on it: *I like solving puzzles, it's fun to me*. 

Your reason might be you want a dependably high salary for the remainder of your working career, you want the prestige/attention that the role garners in the media, you want to anchor yourself to a growth technology and feel that any combination of stats/ML/AI isn't going anywhere, or maybe you just want a job where you can put your headphones on, code, and be left alone for about 50% of the day. There's really no wrong answer, but I think knowing your motivation for entering and/or staying in the field is vital to avoid burnout. 

For me, every one of my three roles has been vastly different. I've trained and deployed models, who were architected by other folks in the org (J1), used transfer learning to build an NLP-based product feature (J2), and most recently, I use stats and experimentation to optimize product-market fit (J3.) Frankly, I found training, deployment, and transfer learning to be a little unfulfilling. It was the hottest area of the new hot thing, and...I felt pretty empty. 

It wasn't until job3 that I realized that I like solving puzzles. Understanding what users want, how they interact with the platform, and why they keep coming back-- it's a really fun puzzle to me! 

Anyway, the DS space is freaking massive, it spans from business analyst to AI researcher. If you're not honest with yourself about what's fun to you, you could spend a few years chasing the hottest thing only to realize that it was a little underwhelming, just another 9-to-5.

"Hey there,
I am currently working on a Marketing Mix Model.
I am having doubts on my modelling approach. 
I didn't find any sources which fit my idea and I want to know if my approach makes sense to you or what could be the caveats with it.

I have ad spend data for two marketing channels for multiple years.
I have around 30 different entities with the according revenue. 
I know that this is panel data. 

My initial approach is to aggregate the revenue over all entities and model this with the ad spend for the two channels for each entity. This gives me 60 variables measuring the ad spend for each channel in each entity for each point in time. I cannot aggregate the ad spend over the entities as I need to know how each channel in each entity contributes to the total revenue. 
A problem with this approach could be that especially for smaller entities their effect on the total revenue could get lost in the noise due to aggregation. 


Other approaches could be to train a model for each entity on it own but some entities are really small and don't have much variance in their ad spend which could be a problem. Also this is tedious as I have to evaluate many models.

Other than that I should probably look into Panel Regression/ Linear Mixed Models.

"So clutter becomes part of a fast moving industry and when I think about this I get a quote from Demming ""Make quality part of the process"" which basically means clean as you go.

This sounds great but over time there is more and more files, folders of info I need to analyze, and my personal archive of data, files, documents, research is somewhere in the 15Tb region which is connected to 260+ GitHub repos. My research library is 1,000+ eBooks and I don't even want to think about my music/video/photo archive right now. 

Now all client data goes back to them, gets deleted or just stays with them, this is data I found, sourced and used for research to work on models that I delivered and got to keep the code but its a hydra that needs a leash.

How do you organize code that is in multiple stages, yet git is a big help, but what about the data associated to each project. Do you store that in one central SQL server or break it up... and saved where?

"A few months ago I had a meeting that I never expected to actually happen, where an employee at a client meeting brought up ""how hard can it be"" to just start running Machine Learning against their databases one at a time and that the ""IT"" department just wasn't wanting to put in the work.

I asked him if he was willing to put in the work for a generalized solution and said ok ""I'll send you a paper, please read up on that and report back what you find"" the following week I sent him this paper. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-019-09914-9#code-and-data-availability](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-019-09914-9#code-and-data-availability) At subsequent meeting he isn't as verbose or hostile against the IT department for being lazy. 

My initial reply was to ask how much data all three of their primary data centers had collected, including the archives, the Oracle Cloud, Google Cloud, both of the failed Azure setups and including their growing AWS presence. How much data in total they had, when was it acquired, how was it cleaned, how often was it used in analysis each month and he looked at me with the ""me not know what you say"" look I see way to often.

So the answer after much back and forth, checking totals, provisioned vs in use and inclusive of non empty folders only is somewhere north of 34.12 Petabytes and somewhere south of 61.3 Petabytes of data. Ok there were little to no data sanitation records, they had about 7% of it had been documented as ever having been analyzed. This data is somewhere between a few hours old and they have information going back to the 1930's in a massive micro-fiche database, then news papers before that and accounting records to the 1700's.

I had this joke in my head about, lets run a regression, of the regression. Then it evolved into turtles all the way down but I kept digging and maybe found something, maybe.

Looking at that much data is just to quote Judith Viorst's book ""the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day"" series of nearly impossible tasks like shoveling sand at the beach to sort it by shape or color etc. There is just too much to run any type of analysis without rethinking the problem which lead me to a few papers I read years ago. This cannot be a new problem, in fact as NTT data has also found its a forever problem. Ok this is starting to sound more fun.

Then I found this paper and somewhere past section 3.1 I can't follow the logic or math to understand what they are saying [http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/112513/7/WRAP-multiple-influential-point-detection-regression-spaces-Leng-2019.pdf](http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/112513/7/WRAP-multiple-influential-point-detection-regression-spaces-Leng-2019.pdf)

Question: On page 386 of the journal article when they say ""leave-one-out"" that refers to a concept like dropout for training ML where you leave holes in your backtesting to see if the model catches itself and doesn't make the error or makes the error and needs fixing?

Has anyone here mucked through this much data before while looking for?

1. Correlation to customer satisfaction that leads to additional purchase
2. Correlation of a customer purchase that leads to said customer referring another
3. Since an aspect of this company is publicly held they are looking for impacts on market price
4. If we go down this road, what can I advise or recommend we do while we are (potentially) looking at this much data. I'm thinking some sort of meta tagging system that would be like time\_series, purchase, market\_segment, net\_promoter\_score, lifetime\_revenue, and so on.

My current plan is to recommend they start by classifying all of the data, one folder or one table of each database at a time programatically with an ensemble of methods. Then expand from there, but there has to be a better method than boiling the ocean.

"Hello,


The Gower distance, or Gower similarity coefficient, is the main recommendation when dealing with mixed data attributes (numerical and categorical).
The following note proposes an alternative that relies on the distance between the probabilities of the attribute values. The idea is relatively simple: has it been tried before? And if yes, what are its main drawbacks?
It seems that such a probabilistic distance should have some advantage over the Gower distance: less outlier distortions and natural extension to ordinal types.

"I just got a job interview for a data science position that requires data science experience. The position offers double my current salary but asks for experience that I lack. If I can get it, I'll be over the moon. Luckily, because of the holidays, I was given an interview in mid-January and was wondering if there is anything I can do in a month to maximize my chances of getting it.

To provide some context, I am a marketing data analyst (with less than a year of experience in the industry) who just completed a 6-month data science course. I learned a lot from the course, but don't have enough practical experience. This position asks for experience in two ML algorithms  (boosting, clustering). I am willing to grind for the next month if it meant that my chances of getting this position would increase. What can be done?

Edit: For those who think that I ""faked it"", I never wrote anything that isn't accurate on my resume. It's the first interview I've got after many rejections. Just because someone gets an interview for a position that requires more experience, it doesn't mean that they lied in their application.

Edit #2: I'm thankful for all the support I'm getting from this community. I'll definitely be going through those and working through them. As mentioned, even if I don't get the position, at least I would have gained a decent amount of experience that would help me in future opportunities! Thank you, everyone.

I know e.g. pharma hires statisticians but the thing is that I somewhat like the data sciency aspects of my current role (but not much more) and wonder if it is possible to find a career that connects these things ((Bayesian) Applied Statistics and Data Science). One problem that comes to mind is that while I do program a lot  (in R) and nowadays in Python, I do not really have this SWE perspective many potential interviewers may ask for. Is there hope or should I just stick to the classical statistcs industries?

I'm deploying R containers containing large xgb models (around 35Mb, 1000 trees), and don't have the budget to just double resources as we've a lot of these models running. The calls are currently taking &gt;100ms for a single row of data (\~40 cols) and becoming a major bottleneck in our calls to prod.

Any suggestions on how this could be tackled? Are different algorithms (lightgbm or similar) likely to offer better results? I'm struggling to reduce the size of the xgb due to accuracy tradeoffs.",Improving xgb prediction times on a single core,datascience

Then once we figured out how to access the software all of the Mac users in the class couldn’t access it so they had to use a different version as a web version that didn’t have all of the same functionality and different menus.

It taught us nothing more than how to point and click different menus and it wasn’t open source so we couldn’t integrate it, the output was sketch and we couldn’t sync this up with changed data.

"I finished my first year anniversary a few months ago at my job as a Analyst at Big 4 consulting firm and I feel stuck at where I am. To briefly (and tbh crudely) describe my current job, I essentially get sent the bitch work and haven’t had a technical task in the last 4 months. It’s my first job after college and I’m super grateful bc tbh I’ve been able to learn a lot and meet so many great people, but I feel like I could’ve been doing more by now. I’ve been applying to other Data Analyst positions and I noticed I don’t pass the more technical side of the interviews. Not to sound bitter, but I feel like my lack of exercising my technical skills at work is causing that. 

Out of the 5 projects I’ve been on the last year and half, only 1 of them has been Data Science/Analytics related. I had a great time at the project too. I got to work on Computer Vision using Python and got to implement a bunch of cool techniques to optimize the program. My team was super encouraging and I even got recognized as associate of the month during that project (not to brag huhuhuh /s). But after that I haven’t really done too many technical things.

I’ve been looking up online courses for Data Science subjects (Data Analysis, Data Viz, AI/ML, Data Modeling etc.) to try to rekindle my drive for Data Science, but I don’t know which to take to since it seems like there isn’t a dedicated group of Data Science certs and I’m just exhausted after work and want to relax.

"Data databases are essential components of nearly every computer program and online service. However, they can be rigid structures that constrain how the data could actually be used. The schemas need to preset for each database system; this means queries must have well-defined semantics written in SQL (structured query language). It’s hard to take advantage of unstructured data with a pre-set schema because everything needs to fit into its specific requirements.

Facebook’s new approach, called [neural databases](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.06973.pdf), will allow machines to search unstructured data – such as vast collections of text or recordings of songs. This could one day enable users to run complex queries like “what is the third-longest entry about a Russian novelist?” directly on Wikipedia.

"I just graduated a month ago with my masters, and I passed technical interviews for a ml job. I only have behavioral interviews left. However, one of my technical interviews with the most senior non-director person on the team raised multiple red flags. He didn't seem to understand basic ML/coding related things. Some of the more egregious examples from my interview:

- Only knows about using AIC/BIC for model evaluation. When I talked about using a validation set to measure out-of-sample performance, he didn't seem to know what I was talking about.
- I mentioned that logistic regression is regression with a sigmoid activation function. He mentioned that it's been awhile and he doesn't remember theory. I was only talking about the forward pass and not optimization. I feel like knowing the basics of logistic regression should be known if you have been in industry for awhile.
- He gave me a coding question that had a very straightforward O(N) solution. After I gave my response, he said it was worse than using a sorting method. Not only does sorting have worse runtime, his solution didn't account for edge cases.

There were more issues than this. Is it a good idea to continue interviewing with this company? The ML team is small, and I would be working with this person regularly.

"Hello!

We are a ghost tour company that operates in Kingston, Ottawa, and Toronto, Ontario, Canada. As lockdowns came into effect in 2020, news outlets began publishing reports that people were experienced increased paranormal or spooky activities in their homes. Which raised the interesting question: **How many of us might live in haunted homes and just never noticed before?**

This intriguing question combined with the desire to try to stabilize our business led us to create a product called - [The Haunting at Home](https://hauntedwalk.com/experience/the-haunting-at-home/). It is a fun and spooky online adventure that challenges participants to conduct six paranormal experiments in their own homes and then submit a report on their results. To date, we have had over 100 reports filled by groups from around the world. We have been collecting this data and sharing those results over the past year. Currently, around 65% of groups are reporting strange activity - much more than we originally hypothesized!

With the Halloween season coming up once again, and an influx of new experimenters expected, it would be wonderful to chat with a Data Scientist about how we are collecting and sharing this data with the public. It feels like we could improve things even more.

If anyone has any ideas about how to best connect with a Data Scientist, who is interested in the paranormal, they would be most warmly received.

* Mercedes -&gt; Mercedes-Benz

For the brand names I am using tf-idf to create embeddings for the different brands using n-grams, after which I am using cosine similarity to select the closest standardized brand name for each non-standardized brand. This methodology works quite well for the brand names but not so well for the model names since there is often not a lot of overlap in the n-grams.

I don't think data science folks (team will include analysts, data scientists, data engineers) are any different than other folks in that regard. Of course I'll also be trying to sniff out who the star performers and self motivators are but that's slower and certainly doesn't come only from the first conversation(s).

"Hello, 


currently I am working on a timeseries of two sensor readings. One sensor is a reference sensor and the second one is our sensor and both are outside. Our sensor has an offset which varies with the humidity. I did a plot of our sensor against the reference, simple scatter plot where x is the reference sensor and y is our sensor. 

I got the regression function y=0.37x+4.673.

My question is, how can I use this to correct my data? I often read something about correction factors in publications and wonder if someone can show me a direction regarding my question.:)

"#TL;DR - Move to a tech hub for more opportunities, better mentors and peer group, ease of job hopping, and higher pay. There's some data and a whole lotta anecdotes.

**Caveats:**

* Applicable mostly only to the US
* Focuses only on SWE and DS roles (sorry PMs, PgMs, Project Managers, etc.)
* Way too many anecdotes for a post written by a Data Scientist

**Background**

I recently made a decision to move from a HCOL tech hub (SF Bay Area) to MCOL city (Atlanta) because I have the ability to work remotely.

I'm fairly established in my career and I lead DS, DE, and ML for one of the bay area tech companies after having spent over a decade in multiple FAANGs.

I actively mentor a lot of junior engineers and scientists and recently got involved in a non profit to mentor some college students who come from non traditional backgrounds. One question I keep getting is about the value of moving to a _tech hub_. I see the same question often repeated here.

Given my role, and quantitative leanings, I did a quick analysis of job opportunities and thought I'll use this as an opportunity to share my findings and my perspective on the benefits of moving to a tech hub. This is by no means a universal truth or an objective measure of quality of life improvements you gain by moving to a tech hub. I recognize that different people have different needs and different wants, and decisions like where to live are deeply personal. 

So here are my reasons for why you should move to a tech hub given the opportunity and ability.

**Reason 1: Number of Opportunities:**

[Number of Open SWE and DS Roles](https://imgur.com/a/N6Gh9ai)
Full data along with source [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/168DCZ2AIyUPyISkwhE_HwPiOEVA5roDSSpzjKw8Rgc0/edit#gid=0)

As of today, there are ~297,000 open Software Engineering and Data Science roles in the US. Of these, ~94,000 (32%) are remote. Let's exclude remote roles from this analysis for reasons I will lay out in the next section.

If you exclude remote roles, a full 53% of the roles are in the top 4 tech hubs, namely: SF Bay Area, DC Metro Area (I reckon there is an over-representation of government related tech jobs), Greater Seattle Area, and NYC Metro Area, with ~19% coming from SF Bay Area alone. If you look at the concentration of Big N type roles, I reckon the distribution will look even more skewed.

**Reason 2: Mentorship:**

While remote working has been a boon to many, I think a lot of the younger engineers and scientists are suffering. I'm seeing this first hand in the teams that I lead. We're trying various avenues (Zoom mentorship sessions, encouraging regular non work 1x1s between juniors and seniors, even having day long open zoom sessions where folks can drop in and out to discuss technical problems) to help the younger more junior engineers have a good experience, but it's not been a good substitute for learning through absorption.

IMHO, remote roles are more suited for Senior Engineers and Scientists who have a track record of delivering independently.  I know this is just one anecdote from one company, but mentorship really does work a lot better in person. Just by pure numbers you have way more people to learn from when you're in a major tech hub. 

**Reason 3: Networking and peer group:**

I know this isn't kosher (and anecdotal) to say, but the _average quality_ of engineers and scientists in the tech hubs is a lot higher than the quality in the other cities. My company has open roles in cities that aren't tech hubs and the difference in quality (and quantity) of candidates we get is night and day.

There's a reason why every tech company worth their salt eventually opens up at least a small office in the bay area or Seattle or NYC regardless of their origin. So you not only have a better than average mentorship group, you also have a better than average peer group.

Not to mention the countless industry conferences, meetups, and networking events that happen in these cities. There are just a lot more avenues to meet like minded people in tech hubs.

The flipside of this is the toxicity and competitiveness that comes along with this. The tech hubs end up attracting the best and the brightest not just from the US, but from across the world, which results in an extremely competitive rat race, especially at the leadership levels. But when you're young and inexperienced, what you learn here will go a long way.

**Reason 4: Ease of job hopping:**

This is just a function of 1,2, and 3. But being around other jobs and building a network of trusted mentors and peers means that when you're looking for something new, it's a lot easier to land another job when you're in a tech hub. It is still my biggest fear having left the Bay Area. I always keep an eye on the job market and the really interesting director / principal / senior manager level roles with the kind of pay I expect only seem to exist in the tech hubs.

**Reason 5: Pay**

This is all relative because by most comparisons, the COL in the bay area is anywhere between 2x to 3x the average COL in other MCOL cities like Atlanta, Dallas, etc.

But, anecdotally I interviewed for a Head of DS position at a very well funded unicorn based in one of the non hub cities and their offer (in terms of TC) was way less than 50% of what I was currently making for a role that's at least 2 levels above my current role in terms of scope. When I said this to them, they essentially shrugged and said this is the best they can do without upsetting their current order. So at some point, I will have to accept a significant pay cut. The lower COL more than offsets this, but if you're someone driven by growth and compensation - this is something to keep in mind.",The case for moving to a tech hub,datascience

Unfortunately, the result of **most analytical work at my large company seems to either disappear with time** **as a person leaves a role** or exist in a stale, undiscoverable, high-level Powerpoint that gets passed around.  

At the moment I have gotten some good formatting/automation mileage out of using the tagging system in JupyterLab along with nbconvert (to HTML/Markdown/PDF), then storing in Github, but **this seems to mostly work only at the individual person/project level.**

The only tool I have seen try to approach this problem is AirBnB's knowledge-repo and some companies selling archaic Knowledge Base services.

"Howdy,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm building out an internal app to store A/B test results. The tests are run using a Bayesian methodology, and we have a full posterior estimate which we sample with n = 1000 per quantity. We are using DynamoDB to store the rest of the data needed for the app, which has a 400KB size limit per record. The sampled posterior as is given is sometimes too large to be stored in DynamoDB as a JSON array. We can store the posterior estimates in S3 as a plan B and store a pointer in DynamoDB instead, but we don't have any need for S3 beyond this so I'm trying to simplify the architecture if possible by storing in DynamoDB as bytes instead.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for suggestions on the most efficient way to ""compress"" a float-only vector. I put ""compress"" in quotes as I expect some standard compression algorithms will be suggested, but I'm not limiting ourselves to just that if there are other methods. Some things I've thought about:  


* Casting from \`np.float64\` to \`np.float32\` - this helps a lot with our test cases, but I am not sure about the implications on accuracy and what problems we could be introducing by going this route.
* binning/""histogramming"" the distribution at some given resolution, but not sure how to decide what resolution/bin size is best to preserve the shape of the distribution universally.
* Sampling fewer than n = 1000, again not sure how best to strike the balance between resolution and storage size
* Storing the percentiles (maybe 1 through 100 by steps of .5) of the posterior and backing into the posterior via inverse CDF, but I'm not sure if this is possible without knowing the form of the PDF/CDF in the first place as posteriors are not guaranteed to take any certain shape unless we always use a conjugate prior which isn't practical.
* As a sort of nuclear option, we can reduce the full posterior to just key statistics like mean, median, and HDI, but as you can imagine, we would prefer to store as much information as possible.
* As mentioned, applying standard compression algorithms but not sure if there are any that are ""better"" for float vectors.

"**TLDR:** In C#, how can one detect the shape of a histogram distribution, where the values are stored in an array? 

**Detail:**

I'm working on a trading system in C# that makes decisions based on the volume of shares traded at each price level during the day. This data is known as the volume profile, and can be visualized as a histogram. See below for the recent volume profile for $SPY, showing the volume of shares traded between $436 and $445.

"Wondering if anyone has any ideas that might work better than my current method.  I’m extracting data from the project management tool Jira. Requests hit our kanban board and are given a Received date/time. Then once the requests are marked Done, they are given a Resolved date.  Our goal is to complete requests within 3 days.   So a resolution time of 3.00 days would be at goal.   I’ve currently been using Excel’s NetWorkday formula to calculate the difference since it pulls out weekends and holidays so easy.  But people complain that the formula counts the day that the request is received as day 1.  So if a request is received on Monday and resolved within 2 hours, it still gives a 1 day resolution time.   If it’s received on Monday at 4pm and completed on Thursday at 8am, it will count it as 4 days even though that’s less than 36 hours (3 days).   

Is there an easier way to calculate the difference between start and finish that doesn’t require me to manually pull out weekends and holidays?   Or should I just simply use the NetWorkday formula and then subtract 1 from the end result to make up for the formula’s flaw?    I’d really like to calculate based on time stamp though so it’s more about the hours it took (and then divide the hours by 24) to be more precise.  But it seems like the holidays and weekends would be tough to pull out.",Calculating time to resolve issues.,datascience

I am working on a personal data project to better determine land I should pursue buying. I have been wanting to secure a plot of undeveloped land \~50-100acres large in North Carolina, Tennessee, or Northern Georgia. I am wanting to use historical data on land value in these areas to help determine what part of the area mentioned might appreciate the most over a few decades. The following are things I want to try and consider in my analysis and use to narrow down my search areas.

&amp;#x200B;

1. General land value per acre in different counties of these states.
2. what the land is zoned for to join to the value per acre.
3. if the land is in any floodzones, wetlands, or other hazard areas and protected areas to join to 1 and 2.
4. historical land appreciation of these states to join as well.
5. I intend to plug this data into BigQuery, tableau, or kaggle to play with.

My intent with this is to be able to filter out areas I can totally ignore and to see if there are any areas with notable appreciation or stagnant value over time indicating a poor area to invest in. I also want to access the difference in appreciation of lands that are zoned for various purposes in these areas so that I can get an idea of if rezoning or excluding certain types of zoned areas would also be prudent.

"First of all, I am a developer but I am not a data science guy. I am asking this question here because I feel that datascience guys and girls have to deal with large datasets and might have some pointers for me.   
   
The use case is pretty simple. You have 2 million rules for eg: 

|ColA|ColB|ColC|ColD|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|GH192|GHMH|\*|349|
|IHK|HK3999|52|\*|

Each row is a different rule in the above table. Rule #1 is stating that the property/column that has name ""ColA"" must have GH192 as it's value. ColB of line item should be ""GHMH"", ColC could be anything at all. ColD should be 349.    


All the columns in the above table would have logical AND relationship among them.   


LineItems:

|ColA|ColB|ColC|ColD|ColE|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|GH192|GHMH|XYZ|349|T1000|
|IHK|HK4000|52|BAC|TAC|

&amp;#x200B;

In the above table we have two lineitems. The first one is a valid one because it satisfies at least ONE of the rules in the first table.   


The second lineitem is invalid as there is not a single rule in the first table that satisfies it. 

There are no range checks. Just exact matches. LineItem could contain extra properties/columns that may not be present in rules. We do not care about these extra columns. For Eg ColE.

  
Obviously, this is a very expensive operation to perform when you are dealing with 5000 lineitems an 2 million rules against which each line item must be validated. A line item must satisfy at least one of the 2 million rules.   


How would you approach this problem? I could perhaps have multiple instances of validator microservice apis whose job would be to take a chunk of lineitems and validate against 2 million rules. OR vice versa. But obviously that is not going to be a very straight forward task.   

Its web application. User is going to save 5000 lineitems (probably via uploading excelsheet which then gets stored in db). This needs to be validated against the already saved rules in the database. 
It has to be less than 10 seconds because pushing it to a queue and sending notification later is not appealing to the customers. Assume everything is string.
We mostly use .NET core and C# with SQL server or MongoDb. Azure as cloud provider.

What are your suggestions? If you have any? Could Hadoop be a solution?

UPDATE1: First of all, thank you for such a great response. I got only 3 comments on StackOverflow for this question. I love reddit! 

A lot of great suggestions really. I tried SQL with all the optimizations that I could do but it took minutes instead of seconds. 

So I tried creating a Trie. And the result was astounding! I was feeling ambitious so I validated 30k lineitems (10x more than original no. of lineitems) against 1Million rules. And guess what? I was able to do so in just 250ms on my laptop. Insane! 

Though there is a major tradeoff. It consumes about 5-6 GB of memory. Which would have been okay but I have found out that we have over 200 clients so if we do store it in memory then we will have to scale different for different client. It is not ideal. Each client will have its own set of 6Gb worth of rules so we can't club them together. 

Building the trie takes 3-5 minutes so its not like we can build the trie and dispose of it with every request. But I have some ideas to optimize it. 

I wonder if there are any databases that let you store data in a form of trie and query on disk? Ofcourse I could do it with a graphdatabse like neo4j but then I will have to hit it for each lineitem.",How to validate 5000 line items against 2 million rules in less than 10 seconds?

"I noticed that a lot of companies fall into the ""no clue what to do with data"" category. I was thinking about starting a company, to service a ""niche"" area within data science. This could be a one-stop-shop type of place where ideally I would be the only employee.

So imagine a small to mid-size company that doesn't have the funds to have a full data scientist or team. This company's core business might be related to tech, it, online shopping or some other industry where they could be losing a lot of money by not making proper use of their data. So instead of hiring a full time data scientist or team, you just bring in someone 'me', who has data science skills, data engineering skills, and analysis skills to do a couple key things:

fix data problems with database, setting up pipelines, getting the right data, etc.

Understanding how data relates to core business, creating actionable insights, building forecasting/prediction algorithms etc.

Maintaining product over period of time, creating something analysts can use, modifying it for future use

So I'd ideally charge some sort of upfront fee such as 10k-50k for the first month, or something like fee based on performance (revenue improvement), and then some sort of monthly fee arrangement for support and maintenance of products.

Example: Right now working on forecasting model with large government organization that could save them a few million dollars per year and lots of hours of headache due to poor past predictions.

"Hello everyone,

First off all, I'm not a native English speaker, so please excuse my mistakes. 

This question might sound silly to most of you, but I'm really struggling to decide whether to use the 'Data Scientist' title or the 'Quantitative analyst' title for the new job that I am being offered with.

To provide a bit of context, I've more than 4 years experience working as an analyst as well as a data scientist at different organizations. Recently I received an offer from a company that provide SaaS solutions for energy markets and the tasks and responsibilities of the new role are primarily focused on developing price models for power markets. 

I feel the Quant tittle is more relevant for the position according to what I am expected to do. Secretly, I have always wanted to be a Quant since I am really passionate about forecasting topics as well as in trading, and I believe this is the ideal opportunity to learn more from very smart people and expand my knowledge in this domain. 

However, I'm a little concerned how the title will affect my future career in the long run. For example, I'm worried that choosing the Quant title will hinder my chances of transitioning into a Data Scientist position sometime in the future, and that I would be treated to be over specialized as a Quant and affect my chances to move into a different domain if I ever want to do it in the future.

I know there's a lot of overlap between quant and data scientist roles, and I know I might be over thinking this. But if someone has any input or experience in being in a similar position before, I would really like to hear about it.",Struggling to decide the title of the new job,datascience

"TLDR: From entry level GIS specialist making $45k at govt contractor to ML developer at same company. How much of a raise should I ask for?

Hi everyone, would appreciate some salary advice as I am moving to a new work role and have no idea what I should be making, (glassdoor etc are all over).

So basically I'm a full time GIS analyst II for a government contractor in a mid-high COL city. I graduated college in 2019 with a B.S. in Geology, now halfway done with my M.S. in GIST. I started my current position right after graduating college.

My boss is leaving and I am taking over all of the machine learning development for our program. (He chose me since I have been a quick learner, have a data science background (college minor) and know Python. I am familiar with all of the Machine Learning/AI workflows (via PyTorch/Azure) and feel pretty comfortable taking over future development although my experience is relatively new. I will also be continuing my old work as a GIS/Remote sensing analyst primary image/lidar processing, managing our statistical outputs and doing QA.

Basically I was hired as an entry level GIS analyst right out of college. Pay started $45,000 and have gotten small COL raises the past 2 years and am now at $46,300ish.

I'm wondering since I am taking over the ML dev should I ask for a raise from my supervisor and if so how much would a fair ask be? I'm in government and still relatively entry level so I certainly wouldn't expect the 6 figures or that some data scientists/ML engineers make or even close to that really, but I do believe I will be undervalued at $46000 especially going from a support role to more of a leadership role in the program. 

I would also like to add that I absolutely love my job and my work culture so don’t plan on jumping ship until I have a bit more experience.

"Machine learning has been possible partly due to the accumulation of data, and within that data, an important step is that of data validation. May it be a data warehouse, database, or data lake migration, all require data validations.

Looking at the importance of data validation, Google recently released the [Data Validation Tool](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/professional-services-data-validator) (DVT). This tool will primarily function as an open-sourced Python CLI tool that would provide an automated and repeatable solution for the process of data validation. The researchers have claimed that this tool would work in different environments with brilliant accuracy. The framework that was equipped for this tool is the [Ibis](https://ibis-project.org/docs/tutorial/01-Introduction-to-Ibis.html). This would act as an intermediary link between the numerous data sources like BigQuery, Cloud Spanner, and so forth.

"I know reddit doesn't represent real life, but just look at the titles of this sub. They're all about tools, code languages/packages, and algorithms. I think to most aspiring data scientists, that's how they see the profession. You're given a tech stack, some data, and your goal is to apply x tool/algorithm to y data. My argument is this is only going to work at super junior levels, and I believe it's the reason why there's a huge oversupply of junior data scientists but teams still can't find competent seniors.  


As another experiment, just head over to r/dataisbeautiful right now. You'll see a ton of different techs used to generate some decent and some awful visualizations. All of those people were able to access, clean, and plot data. There's no shortage of people who can do that.

I feel like every week there's a new topic here on how long until data scientists are obsolete.

Some people call them soft skills, but I'm not a huge fan of the term. It's science. Unfortunately these are the toughest skills to learn and also the toughest skills to interview for, so I don't suspect you'll see companies steering away from technical questions in interviews any time soon.

"I have worked for a few years as Data Analyst and never had a Data Warehouse or Data Lake. Only a classic SQL Server linked with the ERP System and I am not familiar with those concepts. 

I had always selected data through SQL queries from MS SQL (both to analyse with R or to visualize with Power BI or Excel if it was really just something quick) and had my SQL Instance where I could create ad-hoc tables for BI Purposes, such as a table that updates itself daily and put customers in a customer target according to its last 24 months purchasing behavious (frequency, monetary ratio, ..). Everything of course separated from the main SQL Instance linked with the ERP.

now I work for an other company that is deciding between a Data Warehouse or Data Lake and although it is not up to me to decide it, I would like to know whether my SQL knowledge will still be useful or not?

"Hey there, new to the career, on my first contract and things are challenging!

I need assistance in building a pipeline that can tokenize PowerPoint PDFs as well as scrape webpages without any fine tuning.

I am basically building an application for the client in Python where they can input a pdf or webpage, a set of terms, and then the model outputs visualizations regarding the terms within the submitted pdf/webpage. 

The outputs need to be greedy and output any numerical values associated with the term. 

Example:

Input document/webpage:
Report.pdf

Input terms:
'Word',
'Words',
'Phrase of importance',
'Second phrase'

Output:
'word sales increased 90%'
'phrase of importance was reduced 15%'
'$20 million of words was sold last quarter'

I've written the model, which is greedy and works decently well when given strings or documents I have written. 

But building a reliable and low maintenance pipeline is where I am struggling, as well as developing it in an application.

Please note, I am the only person on this contract, and they have no software engineers, no data engineers, no data departments.

"Hi all,

**TLDR:**

**Is there a recommended minimum sample size for customer text review analysis per SKU?**

**If I am to limit the number of reviews for a SKU (with some SKU's reaching over 30,000) and I were to limit the number to say 100 reviews per SKU, should I get the full spectrum of rating reviews, or should I restrict the search to just 1-star and 5-star?**

**What are the implications with the above restrictions?**

Longer version:

I'm having a disagreement with my boss about text-mining customer reviews where the reviews give an ""average"" score.

He wants me to only mine 1-star and 5-star reviews to get the most contrast without having to spend on collecting a wider data set.

My argument (which is anecdotal and why I come to you today) is that not only could it adversely affect any unforeseen analysis moving forward, but there could be actual insights that come from mid-level reviews.

Such insights could be ""I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for"" compared to 1 star reviews like ""It's shit and it's the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my life. This hose caused my divorce and not my anger issues"".

Is there anything else in terms of collecting a more representative dataset than the above from a mathematical/data science perspective that I should consider? Minimum sample size etc?

"I guess this is more of a rant and some validation seeking than a question.

I'm a new-ish data scientist with an esoteric math background. Spent 8 years in pure math, decided I wanted more control over my life than you get in academia, and fell into the gutter of data sci (this seems not uncommon for STEM academics). Didn't really code when I was in math so I wasn't able to hit the ground running, but after a boot camp and an internship, I've just started at a salaried career in the city I want to live in (my hometown, a moderately sized Canadian city that's not exactly a tech hub) at a stable company with a solid looking future.

My internship was a pretty wild, small, python dev environment for a general consulting firm that did a little bit of everything with in-house deployment software. I got to do....pretty much whatever I wanted relating to their projects, which was good for experiencing new technology, but sometimes felt like an absence of leadership and unprofessional ""making it up as you go"" development. Version control and testing were poor to non-existent, and I thought that they were going to get in trouble for deploying too much broken shit/developing solutions with a poor understanding of the associated industries.

It was a good learning environment, but made me want to go corporate/large organization to see

1. Enterprise scale data
2. Stronger implementations of best practices.
3. Projects more related to specialized issues (I despise 'general' data science consultants that try to be everything for all industries)

So now, I'm at my corporate job. It's not a software company, but it's a company with a lot of data. My title has the word data science in it, but I'm not sure anyone here does any predictive analytics. Python development is nonexistent (my work laptop is locked down and IT would probably look weird at me if I requested a proper dev environment). It's primarily a BI/analyst driven environment on the Microsoft technology stack. I'm not sure anyone here uses github, and our ""developers"" are almost all IT/analyst types who work making dinky business apps in PowerPlatform or do dashboard-ey and analysis type stuff in PowerBI and SAP.  We have some access to the Azure ML suite, but I think most of the current staff views it with a bit of terror and confusion. Much of the data activities involve managing multiple ERP solutions duct taped together.

None of this is a surprise to me -- I did know what I was getting into, and I knew that it would be a more business analyst type environment centered around PowerBI outputs, but I'm also finding the reality of it a little jarring and am somewhat worried about my more hard skills atrophying.

On the plus side, it's exactly what I was looking for in terms of career stability. It's where I want to live, the benefits are hella tight, there's opportunity for growth, and I don't have to worry about the company going out of business in any given year.

Is this.....OK? Has anyone else made a transition like this? I'm having mental weirdness about it because I've got lots of friends involved in wild cutting edge shit in a range of academic, data science, and software development environments. They're moving around the world, doing cool shit, developing new algorithms, and getting involved with FAANG type organizations. Meanwhile I'm moving into a career path that specializes in making charts for the C-suite to ignore and misuse.

I struggle with the question of ""to what extent do you have the right to a career of your choice in a city of your choice?"" I like it here. It's got a million people -- it's not like I'm living in bumfuck nowhere. But it's also probably never gonna have the kind of cool, advanced data science opportunities that you get in areas with a FAANG presence or more developed tech scene. And I feel like in my social circle, I'm surrounded by people who view working with those kinds of organizations as the barometer of success.

I think I'm OK with this. I think life exists outside of Toronto/NY/Bay Area/Boston/Austin. I've accepted and I'm comfortable with being a person who works to live and having an unsexy job description. For where I live, this is a pretty damn good job and place to work. I think I can be pretty fuckin good at this. I get to leave at 5 PM, not worry about anything, and go off and ride my bike/fuck around in the mountains, which is not a bad deal. I guess I could also try to reevaluate in like 5 years if this is working for me or not.

So....has anyone else ended up like this? How'd it go for you? Any regrets? Are you doing it as a lifer? Did you do it for a bit and then transition out? How'd you manage?",Coping with moving into an unsexy corporate analysis career.,datascience

"Hello Community,

So…I got charmed by swift as a programming language since quite a while now.

I was hoping it would partially loose its “Apple image” after going open source but it doesn’t seem to have moved a lot since then.

Swift has in my opinion a great potential rivaling Python (while being able to use its packages) and competing with Julia as a language that’s not only powerful (even though not as capable in terms of accuracy etc), but can also deliver products out of exploration fairly quickly (true, mainly OSX and iOS but…I have a hard time finding a language that gets me a beautiful working UI as easily as SwiftUI does).

Also there has been quite some investment; see for example Tensorflow Swift or Googles efforts on bringing Swift to Jupyter notebooks.

However, all of these ambitious projects seem to be archived by now. The hype for Swift as a future language for everything from a few years ago seems to be gone to me.

I might be wrong; but….what happened? Weren’t we just unable to break the “it’s the iOS Programming language” image? Or are people like me who want to see a future in Swift for data science just an irrational exception?

Would love to see your opinions or even better a discussion about Swift’s current state for DS here.

"**Individual neurons of a vanilla feedforward neural network (FFNN) can be interpreted as feature detectors.** More precisely, a single neuron takes the activations from the previous layer as input, then dots them with the neuron's weight vector, and after passing the output of that operation through a nonlinearity, the final result effectively encodes how ""present"" the feature that neuron detects is in that input activations: Larger values mean ""more present"", smaller values mean ""less present"". So on and so forth up through the final layer of a FFNN.

**Significantly, an individual neuron is essentially just a logistic regression unit**, in that the mathematical mechanics underlying how it works are more or less identical to those used in a logistic regression model. **Given that parallelism, it seems like it should be possible to interpret a logistic regression model in an analogous way, i.e., as a feature detector.**

However, given all the neurons operating in parallel as well as all the hidden layers, a FFNN detects many features, whose combined pattern of presences/absences leads to the final classification. By contrast, logistic regression models have only one ""neuron"" (or really, the whole model *is* the ""neuron"") and no hidden layers. This difference begs the question: **If we are to apply the feature detection interpretation from FFNNs to logistic regression, what exactly is a logistic regression model detecting? What is the ""feature""?**

**What I'd propose - but am interested to know the community's thoughts on this - is that what's being detected is simply ""positive class-ness"".** For example, say the logistic regression model is classifying whether a tweet is positive or negative in sentiment. Then what the one and only ""neuron"" is detecting is ""positivity"". Or if the model is classifying whether images contain cats or not, what the ""neuron"" detects is ""cat-ness"". Or if the model is classifying whether radiology scans contain tumors or not, the ""feature"" it detects is ""contains tumor"".

This is perhaps a trivial reinterpretation of what logistic regression does, because obviously a cat detector detects cats. But in my mind at least, **recasting it as feature detection, and accordingly understanding what ""feature"" means in this case, allows me to unify logistic regression and FFNNs in a very natural way that highlights how their components' objectives are really just one in the same.**

**What do you think about this? Do you think this reinterpretation is correct? Do you think it's illuminating/thought-provoking/valuable? Do you think it's at least kind of a cool way to think about logistic regression?** I'd love to hear your thoughts and discuss.

"I have a question regarding NLP clusterization.

I am using SBERT with a pre-trained model to extract embeddings, and k-means to clusterize. The sentences I am using can be really short(sometimes it can be a single word, but around 3-4 words on average), and the datasets are fairly small - around 200 sentences to clusterize per task.

Besides clusterizing, I also need to label every cluster based on its contents.

So far, I have been trying to increase the precision of clusterization by using different cluster counts, but it tends to be unstable. I have tried to clusterize into x clusters, then cut off ""worst"" cluster members(based on center distance or cosine similarity) and recluster them separately.

I have been trying to label clusters with ""best fit"" sentences within a cluster(based on cosine similarity or cluster center distance).

The results don't seem to be too impressive. I feel like the k-means with only 200 data points is a weak spot.. But, still.

In my home country there is a government agency called IBGE that gathers statistics about society and I love poking around them, but I don't even know if they have any use for data scientists. I don't know if they have use for predictive data models, which is the focus of Data Science, as their focus seems to be more ""traditional statistics"". In fact, I think the competition for these agencies is restricted to geographers and statisticians, but I'm not sure. I intend to migrate to the EU at some point in the future and I'm curious what opportunities would be there or in the developed world in general.

I would really like to use statistics to understand/help society. It turns out that I'm discouraged to follow this path when I imagine that my work would only be useful to make money. It makes me question whether I should really choose this career.

"Are there any industry standards for mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive attributes for a firm/organization's knowledge? By managing knowledge I mean the ability to capture new information, integrate it to relevant discussions/topics/idea development, access it as a basis for developing new content without duplicating ideas, and broadcasting the new content. 

For example: **Source** (internal, external, **Desired access** (private, public), **Maturity** (ideation, refinement, published), **Date** (of ideation start, last edit, publication) 

These strike me as very useful, and easy to manage the dependencies (i.e. mostly it would be internal sources that would have ideation and refinement, while published could be shared between internal and external pieces of knowledge) 

Then I get to topic... and things start to break down. I've thought about using language as a taxonomy, with **subject** \- **verb** \- **object** as topic attributes: some entity, took some action, directed at some other entity. These work fine for things like news headlines or policy proposals, but then break down for things like reference materials or constantly updating statistics. 

I realize all these are entirely arbitrary constructions as far as a framework for organizing said knowledge. Hence my interest in industry standards, if any.

"I've been working as a data scientist in a medium-sized company for over two years. The team itself is fairly large, but we largely work on projects for clients that would typically require a single data scientist. As my first data science job after academia, this has given me great exposure to the applications of data science to real-world problems but there is less opportunity for developing large-scale solutions.

I've recently been offered a lead role at a market research company that have a small data science team and are looking to hire someone that can help grow their data science capabilities. The company itself collects their own data and sells insights from this, but have yet to develop any products that use more than standard statistical analysis. From what I know of their business, there's a lot of scope for using more advanced techniques, but I have some concerns about moving from a well-established team to one that is less experienced, will need infrastructure development and the responsibility for the entire team will rest with me.

The prospect of developing a data science team within a company that has a lot of domain-knowledge seems like a challenge, but one that could be very rewarding.

"Some background: Currently working as a DE (first job out of school, tech stack is Azure, Snowflake, dbt, airflow). I love what I do but my heart still lies in statistics and data science work and I’d like to make the transition sometime in the next two years. 

Skillset/Qualifications: I have a BSc (double major computer science &amp; statistics).

"Hi I’d love some input and discussion on a (hypothetical) time series problem/project I’ve been deliberating about (for self practice) that isn’t just career stuff. Time series for me is a field in which I have very little experience and I’d love some high level insights to understand how to approach a problem.

Problem background: predicting the number of job postings (eg LinkedIn or a job board) in the upcoming week/month to help recruiters/board company optimize for (lack of) incoming openings.

The basic setup is a simple time series of say, counts/logs of jobs posted per day over a few years. 
I think there’s more value if:

1. We don’t look at total jobs listed but try to predict per job title (or some broader category if not feasible). For example the number of predicted data scientist jobs, software engineer jobs, IT management jobs, etc. My idea is to train a text classification model to parse raw job descriptions into job categories, and input this into the time series. Train a separate model per job (category).
2. Apart from the basic trends improve the prediction by adding external features such as macroeconomic indicators (e.g via an API or web scraping) or sentiment related to job posts or news (again using an NLP model to provide input to the time series model). I have no idea how/if this is feasible with specific time series models though (opposed to eg regression).
3. Retrain the model(s) periodically to ensure it keeps close track of latest market trends and external events (e.g new macroeconomic indicators that are released periodically). 

Specific questions:
- what are current “state of art” time series algorithms I could look into? 
- how to best include external variables into such a model? 
- how does prediction timeframe make a difference eg predicting the next week vs month or day?
- generally: does this approach make sense/is it feasible or are there better ways to think about this problem?

"Hey there,

I am a data scientist myself, working in a small team of other data scientists (&lt;5). I'm soon reaching the 1-year cap, and I found out that code understandability/project onboarding (at least in my team) is a problem.

Most of my teammates are really good at math and statistics in general, but once I have to dive into one project, I just lose so much time trying to read their code and understand their explanations.

This can be hurtful, firstly because losing time is never a good thing, but also because it kind of makes me feel like an idiot to not be able to onboard a project without losing hours running and understanding all the code (and it can get very long if, on top of that, it's based on complex mathematics :p ). 

Of course, implementing better code practices such as commenting and better naming would be a good thing, but this idea is often met with the ""We don't have time to do that, we have worse problems and priorities"".

"**CONTEX**

You work in a Retail Bank and as a Data Scientist you're called by the Marketing and Customer Value Management departments to work on a problem with a data-driven approach.

They figured out that many individual retail customers use their current account and debit/credit cards for business purpose (they are SME - Small Medium Enterprises - disguised as retail customers) and they want to find those 'hidden business' customers in order to reach them out with a cross-selling opportunity (e.g. open also a business account and keep your personal and business expenses separated, allowing lower taxation, etc.)

When you do some EDA on debit and credit card spendings you find out examples of retail customers with thousands of dollars per year spent on Facebook Ads, Google Ads, stores for business purchase only, etc. and you plan to use those features to train a model that identifies the 'hidden business' among the retail customer base.

**PROBLEM**

If your plan is to train a binary classifier you will soon figure out that the problem is that you have positive labels (customers with a business account and debit/credit card) but your negative labels are actually unknown: you don't know if they are hidden business or actual retail customers.

The standard metrics you will use to compute error and performance (AUC, precision, etc.) would be also flawed because you want to find out errors (e.g. customers with high scores of being a business but actual retail) not minimize it.

Also, you will end up doing training and scoring on the same dataset of the overall bank customer base.

"I'm a 26 year old Social Sciences grad considering a return to academia and I'm very interested in applying ML methods as part of a PhD research proposal at the intersection of Political Science / Public Policy and Development Studies.

More specifically I'd like to assess the value provided by ML methods as part of a mixed methods approach to research with the aid of one or several case studies, with significant attention paid to methodological and epistemological concerns, engaging with the work of forerunners in the field such as Lakoff, Zadeh, Sartori and David Collier. As such, applying ML methods would be a significant portion of my research, but definitely a minority. Specific algorithms of interest would be determined by the case studies in question and what I'm capable of competently applying, but would likely centre around regression/classification and text analysis.

Once upon a time I had basic but fairly solid statistical skills along with more rudimentary technical skills in SQL, R and to a lesser extent Python, but these have unfortunately atrophied to the point of non existence after 3-4 years in a non-technical Data Science adjacent role. I therefore have a pretty steep hill to climb in terms of foundational skills before I could even submit my research proposal. I'm currently brushing up on algebra, calculus and statistical skills before pushing in to the unknown, most likely via the MITx Micromasters in Data, Development and Economics and/or in Data Science. However the sheer scope and complexity of the content I need to cover combined with working a full time job and the fact that a PhD position is by no means guaranteed at the end of it (I'm provisionally interested in Oxford or LSE) is pretty disheartening. As a result I'm interested in exploring low code / no code options such as KNIME and DataIku (I'd also welcome alternative suggestions) for data prep and model build to reduce the barrier to entry. I'd really value any input on whether these would be fit for purpose, specifically:

1. Will the choice of algorithms available fit my needs?
2. How low code are they exactly? In practice will I need to plug in significant amounts of my own code?
3. Do they provide sufficient guidance or hand holding to build models of sufficient quality for a top tier PhD program (keeping in mind that building the ML models would only be a relatively small portion of my research - I certainly wouldn't expect this to be the case if it was a purely quantitative thesis). To take some basic examples, would they flag if my variables were collinear, heteroskedastic etc

Thanks for reading, I'd really value any input! Happy to provide some more details on my (somewhat vague) research proposal if that'd be helpful or of any interest.",Feasibility of using no code / low code platforms such as KNIME and DataIku for social science research,datascience
"Hi everyone!

I am undergrad majoring in Political Science and minoring in Data Science. I am now working on my undergraduate thesis and have realized that, while scraping election data from the websites of different states, there is very little consistency. In a single state, URLs are formatted completely differently, the tables come out in many different forms after I scrape, and reformatting takes me quite a bit (\~15 minutes for each site, but I have 100 of these to go through, making the data cleaning alone a 25 hour project).

Are there any ""tricks"" to automating data cleaning/making a robust program that can accept many different data forms? Or is data cleaning always just a bit of a pain in the a\*\*?",General Question on Scraping Websites and Data Cleaning,datascience
"I once watched a video where someone argued that Michael Jordan had ruined basketball. As a person whose only notions of basketball come from Space Jam, this surprised me. Wasn't the guy the best out there? How could someone who's best in his field ruin it?After hearing the argument out though, I began to understand what the video was really getting at: to them, Michael Jordan had ruined the field BECAUSE he was so good. A sport that was once full of diverse personalities and strategies and then turned into multiple teams trying to produce their own Michael Jordan copycat with copycat moves and copycat strategies.

I'm not well versed enough in basketball to know how right or wrong that guy was. But this concept that something could ruin an entire field simply by being too good stuck with me. And all these years later, I consistently think about it while doing my job as a Data Scientist. And the more GPT-X and ChatGPT advance, the more this concept haunts me.

I've been working in this field for 5 years. During the first 4 years, the job was exciting. Every new problem required extensive research on my part: looking for papers, datasets, implementations, implementing my own stuff, experimenting, comparing the results... That was the biggest part of my job. Yeah I still had to do some software engineering stuff here and there, but I felt like I had a well defined and specialized role at my company. Even in the NLP field, the variety of technologies I had to work with was a lot of fun: sometimes I used RNNs, sometimes embedding based similarity functions, sometimes more classic approaches, and then towards the end it was transformer after transformer, but at least I still had to finetune them myself.

Over the past few months and years, this has started to change, however. GPT-1 and 2 were promising, but were more of a proof of concept than anything realistically usable. But with GPT3's and ChatGPT's latest performance, it feels like NLP is becoming more and more standardized. I wouldn't call it a solved field, far from it. But, sadly, unless you work for a big tech company,  I think the days of exploratory research-type work in the NLP field are over.

Even in academia, the latest NLP papers I've seen come out of prestigious universities went from actual engineering/mathematical advances to ""Look, if you ""engineer"" the prompt like this, it works better sometimes!""

And now, with the exploding popularity of ChatGPT, any random lambda would come to the conclusion that if you need to use AI, ChatGPT is the answer.

Now, some of you may already be thinking ""but hold on, with my finetuned transformer I get a 1% increase in accuracy over out-of-the-box GPT-3!"". The thing is: even if you can, it doesn't really matter. I really doubt the sales team of your company is gonna pay much attention to your pleas to give you 6 months to work on a product rather than 6 minutes. Because yes, that's the increase in productivity we're dealing with: What took me months a few years ago only takes minutes now. The range of problems I can apply NLP too has also increased, as out-of-the-box GPT-3 works well enough not to require a dataset for more ""general"" tasks. And the results are either comparable or even better.

In the span of a year, NLP went from my favorite ML field to one I never see myself working in again if given the choice. And while a lot of non NLP fields are, for now, untouched by the exploding popularity of the GPT family. But I'm afraid that what happened to the NLP field will be replicated in other fields, and that in a few years, only super specialized issues won't have a solution somewhere in the form of a ridiculously big model accessible via an API key provided by a big tech company. And even if GPT3 was open source, the sheer size of it makes it close to impossible to realistically train for anything less that the biggest of tech companies out there. Even finetuning it would be a challenge.

I'm not saying the job of data scientist will disappear, in fact, I'd say it will be asked more than ever since boomers who don't understand what the title actually implies will want some in their company. But we won't be doing nearly as much actual data sciency stuff as we did in the past. Instead we'll have to become even bigger software engineer/data analyst/DevOps/project manager hybrids than we already were.

It's not that much of a problem for people who like the roles I listed above. But for people like me, whose enjoyment came out of the exploratory side of the job, I believe the future to be bleak.",I am worried about the future of working as a Data Scientist in industry,datascience

I need to learn Python and also brush up on Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Statistics between now and August which gives me about 6 months to prepare. I started taking the ""Python for Everybody"" course by Uni of Michigan on Coursera, but I saw somewhere that it takes about 8 months to complete. This got me wondering if I should take a shorter Python course that is specifically for Data Science (such as the ones on DataCamp which I have access to from my job).

I like working with numbers and data a lot, I'm pretty good at math and am okay with staristics, so I thought I might be suitable for a career in DS.

So, for my master thesis I thought to myself I want to learn as much as possible and write a really good thesis, so that I will be able to switch to a job in the field. 

After researching for very long I decided that I will write my thesis using Twitter data, because they are easily scraped and ressourceful.

"Hi there,

## Share notebook with non-technical users (managers)

Sharing results from Jupyter Notebook might be a pain:

- you can't share notebook to stakeholders because they don't speak Python, cant run notebook by their own,

- you need to copy-paste charts into PowerPoint presentation,

- you need to rewrite your results to some web framework to make your results interactive.


Jupyter project offers a Voila as a solution for running notebooks as web apps. I found Voila a difficult to use, especially ipywidgets.

## Mercury 

I started to work on my own open-source framework for running notebooks as web apps. Mercury allows you to add interactive widgets in Python notebooks, so you can share notebooks as web applications. It offers a set of widgets with simple re-execution of cells.

GitHub repository: [github.com/mljar/mercury](https://github.com/mljar/mercury)

Documentation: [RunMercury.com](https://RunMercury.com)

## What you can build

You can use Mercury Widgets to create:

- [web apps](https://runmercury.com/tutorials/web-app-python-jupyter-notebook/), reports, dashboards,

- [presentations](https://runmercury.com/tutorials/presentation-python-jupyter-notebook/) - use widgets to interact with slides, slides are recomputed during the slideshow

- [websites](https://runmercury.com/tutorials/website-python-jupyter-notebook/) - share notebook as static HTML (with code hidden), 

## Features

Unique features that make Mercury different than Voila or Streamlit

- simple re-execution of cells after widget update,

- all input widgets are displayed in the sidebar, your app layout is ready,

- authentication to control access to notebooks (coming soon),

- easy file upload and download in notebook,

- export result to PDF or HTML with button click.


## Future plans

I would like to provide a cloud service for notebook deployment. You will upload notebook and it will be available as web app/website.

"Hi! I’m currently a master’s student in Computer science, specializing in data science/data mining. I’m about to graduate soon and I am already starting to look for full-time jobs in the industry. I’m open to do internships or a new grad program or any full-time position as a data analyst, data scientist, data engineer, machine learning scientist/researcher (any of those positions work for me). It’s actually my first time applying/working in industry and I just have a couple of questions:

1) What is/are some thing(s) that you did that you learned not to do? (e.g., mistakes/pitfalls that should be avoided)? Or perhaps things that you regret not doing?

2) My second question is in terms of applying for jobs. I have heard from some colleagues and have read from some posts in this subreddit that job hunting can be rough. For example, one has mentioned how he applied for 400+ jobs and still no success. I currently have applied to I think around ~70 already and I’m starting to see what he meant. I only heard back from a couple of companies but all of them rejected me (actually, one company that I applied for reached out to me and said they wish to proceed with my application, but I also found out through my research that the company was a bit shady with their practices, so I’m glad I didn’t decide to respond to them and just dodged the bullet). But idk, maybe the resume I’m using has some problema. I’m using one and only one resume (2 pages) for all positions (and companies) I’m applying for (I also have a CV, which is a longer version of my resume; 7 pages). I also thought and I fear that my resume has become overloaded (full of loaded text and description with very minimal margins and is very tightly compact). I put a short professional summary of myself and then my education. I also have 4 publications, 4 (top) side projects, and 4 (related) course projects, each with around 2-4 bullet points of descriptions (bolded significant and relevant words). I also include my one and only internship experience (insurance industry) and description in bullets and my current job experience as a teaching assistant for big data science courses. I also included volunteer works (apparently, employers here in Canada tend to look at those as well). I also added the Technical skills. Idk if there’s anything I could improve on it? Am I overloading it? Should I reduce to 1 page? 

I highly appreciate your time, thanks so much!

"I’ve been working at a company for about a year and a half, the team team I’m on is supposed to be integrated with other teams cross functionally but the director of my skip level team is painfully bad at…well…directing. There doesn’t appear to be any process to how teams are supposed to work together. He’s produced no guidance or overview or set his priorities for work. 

What results is that an escalation will be forwarded to some teams to work on individually while other teams find out about an escalation only through rapid fire messaging or through another team. 

Teams duplicate work because nobody is placed in charge to manage the escalation. So multiple reports are generated on a single escalation and nobody really knows who the stakeholders are nor have they worked with them in any capacity. Basically everyone tries to answer any possible questions because no specific question is asked. 

I’m confident this issue is at my skip level and not my first line leader who is often as confused as I am about how to proceed when someone just says “do data science” with no meeting or planning or scoping of any kind.

"Hello World,

I hope you can help me here.   Based in London, live here and work here.

Quick summary about my career.  Been working in human resources for the past ten years and have worked in particular niche of human resources, which is compensation and benefits.  My role has been a compensation analyst.  I've done this role at the same level and have had the opportunity to work in different companies and in different sectors.  The part that appeals to me is the data side of things.  I enjoy working with data, creating insights, visualisations.  It allowed me to work with a lot of employee data and doing a lot of analysis ranging from  analysing salaries, gender equity analysis, bonus modelling, automation in processes and more.

Along the way, I got technical skills in Excel (advanced user, building macros), Power BI, and Python (last year i've learnt quite a bit ranging from Pandas, matplotlib/seaborne, web scraping, SQL and databases, selenium)

Now would like to do a lateral move and move into data science.  I have the following questions:

1.)  Has anyone here done a move from a differnet field and went into data science?  If so, what was the transition like and how did you get your first data science role?

2.)  What tips would you give to get into the data science field?  (e.g what other skills need to be learned, create a project portfolio, recruitment agencies, a network I can join that can help in finding opportunities?)

"Hello everyone. At my job (consulting) my team was asked to improve the monitoring of project advancement at the client's firm. In particular, they struggle with defining a milestone baseline at T0 and sticking to it without rescheduling. They would also like a theoretical economic advancement of the project to compare against the actual technical progress (mainly SW development projects). 

The manager proposed a ""per-case"" approach, which means defining with the client's Project Manager at T0 the most probable date of each milestone and the project duration, while estimating a corresponding economical effort for each milestone, to be divided for each milestone duration.

Since we actually have last year's reporting data on this process, I thought about proposing a more statistic-based approach. 

I would like to create a model where for each Project Manager/Project we create a ""standard baseline"" based on the historical data, and a ""deviation model"" based on the project/task rescheduling pattern of the past year. In my mind, this would allow the generation of all the project baselines in a more structured way than discussing every single milestone relying only on the Project Manager's gut feeling. This would also allow some ""rolling"" adjustments to the deviation model while every monthly monitoring cycle is closed.

Now, I am just starting to look into linear regression algorithms, could this be the right approach for this project? I kinda cannot figure out how to build the database for this. I do not have a data scientist in my team to brainstorm together, unfortunately. My main concerns are:

1- Not all of last year's projects did not start at T0, and they do not have the same duration. I take that to properly analyze the data I would need to fill those NaN with something, but I can't really stretch the time series or put the average value, since it's a % progression from 0 to 100%. Would it be of any help if I, for a start, reset all the projects as they were starting at T0?

2- Some projects from the past year are still rolling, so I do not have all the data points up to 100%, can I still make a somewhat accurate estimation?

3- I imagine the dataset defined by a column for each project, with on each row below the % of advancement for each monitoring cycle (1 month). I guess this is correct, but how do I fit in the same structure also the ""deviation"" for each project?

4- I take that once the problem has been framed, it would still be needed a lot of coding and testing all the hypotheses, but I can put a small team with some python knowledge to work on that. What are the steps I cannot miss in order to deliver a sound baseline/deviation forecasting model?

5- I looked for some literature examples exactly on this use case, but I couldn't find much. Can you point out some papers that I can use for learning the methods and the critical steps?

Thank you everyone in advance.","New to DS, help me frame this problem",datascience

"How should I go about Forecasting Estimates.

I’m building a custom forecast using QuickBooks &amp; Hubspot’s API

My X axis of my chart consists of the following data:

Actual: Revenue
Expected: (0.5 x (Deal Probability x Deal Value) + Revenue) + (
New: Deal Probability x Deal Value

My Y axis is each month.

My question is I want to track revenue from closed deals, but the final 50% of the closed deal, as you can see I’m tracking the first 50% in expected. 

I thought about using estimates as that income is guaranteed within the next 2 months, but invoices do not exist for them yet. So for income where I know is guaranteed for X day of the month, this isn’t tracked in quickbooks.

The issue with using estimates is as soon as the invoice is made, the estimate total doesn’t go down. So I can’t go the estimate route because it’ll create duplicate income.

I suppose i can track this manually? But the whole goal is automating this.

Any ideas? Sorry if I explained poorly :/

"I’m pursuing a MS in Applied Data Science at a reputable STEM-focused university, which prides itself on working closely with employers and industry professionals when crafting their course plans. I also chose this school because it was the only one near me offering a DS program without having to go online. This is the 3rd year of the program being offered. 

The professors are great people who seem to thoroughly enjoy what they do, but the program itself is turning out to be a haphazardly slapped-together shitshow. Most of the courses are lumped together with the undergraduate CS courses, and as such the times which they are held aren’t conducive for working adults who don’t live on campus, despite the school claiming they would be. And while the professors are great, none of them seem to be on the same page with what the program is intended to accomplish. When starting the program, we were all told that everything will be done in Python. A couple terms later when I’m just starting to delve past the beginner stages, another professor decides he wants to teach in R. In the database class, the professor is hellbent on typing out SQL queries on a Word document rather than actually implementing them in Workbench. I was also forced to take a “Management Science” course to fulfill an elective due to limited course availability for one term, which revolved around optimization problems in Excel, which was basically a repeat from undergrad. 

A positive to come out of the program is that I was able to land a supply chain analyst role upon graduation due to the school’s industry connections, which is good since I worked in supply chain previously, so I can apply DS principles to a domain I know a little about. I was also fortunate enough to be able to use my GI Bill for the program, so I’m not out any money. But, I can’t help but feel I was the Guinea pig for this school while they hopped on the DS bandwagon, and that my skill set is still a far cry from being a data scientist in terms of coding and statistical knowledge.

"As the title says, I've been in my first data science role for about 6 months. This post is mainly just to ask whether what I'm experiencing is common within professional data science. 

The main crux of my role is deriving datasets from raw data. It might be as simple as creating flags based on the value within a column or it could be a little more involved with summarising and cross-tabbing. The thing is, once I've created the dataset and it's been QA'ed and sent off, I don't actually do any analysis to it. I don't look for insights or interesting features or make predictions, perhaps the only EDA I do is to look for anomalies to make sure something hasn't gone wrong in the processing. 

My first proper project in the first few months was to create one such dataset, once that was finished I was then put onto recreating an existing dataset using different and more reusable data sources. Our department has a data engineering and data modelling team which also derive some datasets but I've never had to use them as I never seem to do any actual analysis. 

Basically, is this normal? I anticipated that lots of the job would be data cleaning and manipulation, but I seem to be doing the bulk of the actual coding and putting together of the data without then getting to do anything with it. I don't think I've even made a histogram yet. 

What is frustrating is that there's a fairly sizeable bonus to salary offered if you can demonstrate that you're using advanced data science or analytical techniques, however I rarely (if ever) get the opportunity to actually use them therefore I doubt I'll be able to get the bonus.

I'm weighing up my options. I'd like to stick around for at least a year and there's the potential to go up to senior data scientist. What I'm missing currently to go up to senior are the usual soft skills like interdepartmental communication, managing projects, time management and decision making. All things which I would build up if I stick at this job, what I'm concerned about is how my actual data science projects would translate to applying to other companies in the future.

Answering  questions based on domain knowledge (like internal documentation,  contracts, books, etc.) is challenging because of the size of the domain  knowledge.

As you might know,  Transformer-based models are limited in terms of input size (most of the  time it's hard to use more than 2048 tokens). So you cannot really do  question answering on a huge knowledge base with these models.

You  can try to fine-tune your own text generation model for that (like  GPT-3, GPT-J, etc.) but results are sometimes disappointing as the  fine-tuned models tends to forget some of the facts mentioned in the  dataset...

[https://nlpcloud.com/question-answering-on-domain-knowledge-with-semantic-search-and-text-generation.html](https://nlpcloud.com/question-answering-on-domain-knowledge-with-semantic-search-and-text-generation.html?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=h5d7a9cc-3816-11ed-a261-0242ac140006)

As far as we know, this is the best way to get both a fluent and user friendly answer while being very accurate.

I would love to hear your thoughts on this. Can you think of a better strategy for question answering on very large documents?

cross_val_predict yields the actual predictions from the CV. E.g., if there are 5 folds, then the output of each sample is its predicted value when it was in the test fold (trained on the other 4 folds of data).

I've been spending the last 6-8 months getting myself comfortable with the basic things one needs to know to be a data scientist. Python, SQL, statistics, classification, regression, etc.... you get the point. I feel like I could study forever and not be prepared for interviews, though. 

I guess my question is, what do you expect in interviews when you know someone doesn't have the typical background? How would you prepare if you were me? I'd really love to get a job that recognizes that I have a strong quantitative and scientific background and is willing to invest in me as an employee... am I being unrealistic thinking I could find a job like this?

I feel that I have been a strong performer when I was an optical engineer/optical physicist (my coworkers and supervisors have told me as much), but I don't really know if it is appropriate to bring up those projects in a DS interview or if I need to give myself a substantial data science project and just stick to talking about that in an interview.

I did my fair share of data analysis too, but a lot of the data analysis feels really straightforward from a data science perspective.

"Hello!   
I'll try to keep this short and to the point.

I am preparing to re-enter the field of ""data science"" following a 2 year stint at a startup where I was fulfilling more of a product design and business development role. I found that work to be very interesting and rewarding but at the moment, I'd like to go back to developing a harder skill set.  


Some background on me.  
I have a bachelor's in business management (2013) and completed a Ms Stats/Data Science program January 2019.  
I worked 2+ years as a data scientist at a large US tech company (supply chain). This work was mostly boring and not consequential, so I left for something more exciting.  


So as I begin to prepare to re-enter the data science field, I'm curious how much has changed and how I can best prepare myself..

I have questions but I am also seeking general anectdotes and advice.

* What is the typical tech stack in a data science team these days?
   * In my previous role I was modeling in R and Python depending on the use-case
   * Some light dashboarding
* What's ""up and coming""
   * Besides ""AI"" coming for everyone's jobs
   * What's new that is making folks more effective?
* Have technical interviews changed? What's the status quo?
   * I've previously ""gotten away"" with offers that didn't require tech interviews but I see that as a flag now
* Suggested material for re-familiarizing myself/catching up?

"One very useful benefit I found with ChatGPT for job seekers is asking it to serve as a Hiring Manager that asks you questions for the specific role you're interested in.

To help it guide you, you need to provide it with some context based on the job description. For example, you list out the job description to ChatGPT and say that you want to be asked questions on causality and experimentation.

Here's the response from ChatGPT based on the following prompt I provided it after sharing the job description:

===**PROMPT BY ME===**

I would like you to be a hiring manager. I'll be soon interviewing with you for a Data Science role, and you are going to ask me questions related to causality and experimentation. What are the questions you would ask to test me knowledge?

**==RESPONSE BY CHATGPT===**

Sure! As a hiring manager for a data science role, I would like to assess your understanding of causality and experimentation. Here are a few questions I might ask:

1. Can you explain the difference between correlation and causation, and give an example of each?
2. How do you design an experiment to test a causal hypothesis?
3. How do you ensure that the results of an experiment are valid and reliable?
4. Can you explain the concept of confounding variables, and how do you control for them in an experiment?
5. Can you explain the difference between a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and an observational study?
6. How do you measure the impact of a treatment or intervention in an experiment?
7. Have you worked with any causal inference methods such as propensity score matching or instrumental variables? Can you give an example of when you used them?
8. How do you determine which variables to include in an experiment, and how do you avoid overfitting in the modeling process?
9. Can you discuss any challenges or limitations you have encountered in designing and conducting experiments, and how you overcame them?
10. Can you give an example of a real-world scenario in which you applied causal inference or experimentation methods to solve a business problem?

I originally was planning on going into software development however my last semester I took my university’s intro to machine learning course and really enjoyed it and decided to pursue data science. 

So far I’ve just been going through online resources to familiarize myself with the field and how to make myself a more suitable candidate. Learning the basics of data preprocessing, wrangling, and EDA. I did an introductory course on PyTorch to learn more about ML frameworks and modeling.

I know the next step is to start building a project portfolio but I’m at a bit of a cross roads. From what I’ve read it’s pretty difficult to get an entry level data science job right out of college and you really have to have an outstanding project portfolio or resume. Although I went to a really good public university, I made a lot of mistakes, my gpa is subpar, I only have one front end dev internship under my belt and I haven’t started a project portfolio besides basic EDA and modeling to learn. 

I really want to enter the work force as soon as possible and don’t know if I have the time to build an impressive project portfolio to get an entry data science position. The advise I was given was to start applying to data analyst positions and gain experience for a year or two. In the meantime to be doing independent projects and might even do a one year masters program with a focus in ML/DS and then transition to data science.

&gt;We do understand your concern.  
We tested the same scenario in our local environment and found that if we search parent subject (Top level), the child LO is not returned in the search results.  
This is as designed, this only searches using the subject select and does not include child subjects.  
As a workaround, when the subjects are set up in training, you can also add the parent and child both subjects so that both will be displayed in the Search.

I'm 95% sure this is a dumb answer, right? As in, if it wasn't going to be included in the search for the parent, then it's not really a nested ""child"" subject... it's just a... completely different subject.

My strategy was to use a lag to bring up the next row in order to be able to compare them- and the recursion would have been required in cases where a user had 3 or more overlapping sessions. But according to the interviewer, there is a different solution (I asked and did not get the answer).

Now the problem is, while I love to learn all of them and I am fully motivated to do so. I just wanted to inquire about which softwares/languages should i focus in order to land any junior data analyst role. I am a quick learner and I know i will continue to work on myself even after I land a role but till then I do not wish to remain unemployed if that makes sense.

"TLDR: making stuff go pew pew algorithm development vs traditional data sci in health insurance

Offers acquired! Woo hoo! Now the dilemma of choosing one. They both pay around the same, so that's not a factor here.

The first is an algorithm development intern position at a well known DoD contractor. It's definitely more math stat oriented. In the interview, I talked a lot about my schoolwork in Computational Stats I and II using Kalman Filters and stuff we did with MLE. I'd be making things blow up.

The second one is a more traditional DS intern role in health insurance. I gave good answers on the details of XGBoost and wrote queries in SQL to identify who was overcharging for certain meds, etc.

I don't really have an interest in either of these fields to be completely honest with you. With this algorithm development job, it does seem fancier, but I feel like I'd be pigeonholed to working in defense because of it. I imagine interviews later on would go along the lines of:

 *""What did you do at \_\_\_\_\_?""* 

*""Well I used a bunch of crazy algorithms to make heat seeking missiles!""*

 *""Ehh that's not really what we're looking for. Thanks!""*

The second job in health insurance seems like a complete tornado slip slide into corporate mediocrity. Health insurance seems just as scummy as defense in my opinion. And the company is known to take advantage of people. The people I know from high school/college who work in health insurance don't seem like they're happy about it.

But my chances are pretty low/ nil as it's pretty late after - cycle is almost over. So I've included some lower ranked Unis for DS in my shortlist (Stevens institute of technology being my fail-safe) 

But I came across a fact that acceptance rates for MS Business Analytics programs at most UCs and other Top Unis are surprisingly VERY high.

Although the low gpa is a concern, my profile fits much better for Data Science but isn't bad for top BA programs that do have DS courses in curriculum as well. 


I'm concerned with the outcomes of a BA degree - primarily high-paying opportunities (in any domain or role, matching ~$200K Data Scientist salaries in bay area/ NYC), and prevalence of a switch back to DS / MLE / Applied research roles after BA degree if previous work ex demonstrates proficiency in ML/DL.

I use this sub as a direct resource for learning data science so your advice is very much appreciated on my end.

Currently I’m an undergraduate studying Data Science at a top 10 school globally. Although I’ve felt that my major’s curriculum has helped me establish a solid understanding of the math, programming, and analytical aspects of data science, my major has generally been focused on predictive modeling rather than inferential modeling. 

At this point in time, I have taken four different ML/DL courses where I’ve gained a pretty strong grounding in classical ML techniques, core DL frameworks, and implementation/productization. However, although I’ve learned through classes and self-studying regression analysis and hypothesis testing, I have yet to take a class solely dedicated to inferential modeling as a whole.

This coming quarter, should I take my 5th ML/DL course to further establish my knowledge and approach to predictive modeling, or should I take a course solely dedicated to Applied Regression Analysis (name of the course) to gain a better grounding in inferential modeling?

"So long story short, my undergrad was in international affairs, nothing technical. I touched R a little bit but nothing extensive. I decided during the pandemic I was going to push to get a STEM masters to supplement my undergrad and I knocked it out. I really enjoyed it and I can use a ton of tools to develop ML solutions and deploy models end to end in Sagemaker. I’ve even become an OK programmer. The issue I have is many of these solutions and tools are black box. I can apply the tool to solve a problem but I don’t always know how it works and, being honest, there’s a lot of effing tools. 

I feel like I’ve got a good warm and fuzzy about what data science and ML can do and what it can’t but I find a lot of jobs will post their need for people with extensive education in quantitative skills, or vast experience with A/B testing which I understand but haven’t done extensively, or 6 years building solutions with Tensorflow. Thus, I feel like I might be wildly under skilled despite the degree. 

Maybe the industry is just so flooded now that DS roles really require a deep specialized knowledge because it’s so competitive. Seems like there are lots of PhD roles in industry these days.

"First off, I am an international student based in South Asia, and I applied for data science masters programs in the US and UK to get my foot into the field. My major is in Economics and I made the decision to transition into this field pretty late (in my junior year), so I spent the holidays studying math and stats when everyone else was chasing internships (most of them failed due to covid19 though, so I guess I made a good choice). 

I didn't have high expectations when I applied to masters programs in both countries (since my major wasn't that quantitative imo), but surprisingly I was given an offer by two universities - one for each country. For the UK, I was contacted by the University of Oxford to study MSc (Master of Science) Social Data Science, and for the US I was given an offer by Harvard university to study MS Data Science in their engineering department. Now I need to choose one between the two programs.  

I did a lot of research, and currently here are what I believe to be the pros and cons of each program based on its curriculum and location:

&amp;#x200B;

Oxford 

 [OII | MSc in Social Data Science (ox.ac.uk)](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/study/msc-in-social-data-science/) 

Oxford's program is not as rigorous as standard MS Data Science programs (see the 'Social' part) because their curriculum focuses on applying data science in social science contexts, and the program lasts for 1 year, but it provides a lot of training on how to extract insight from data with a social science lens and I believe this will be useful if I wish to become a data analyst. 

The best thing about Oxford is that it is based in the UK, where you can apply for a 2-year graduate visa after graduation. This visa allows students to stay in the UK for 2 years to get some experience (such as internships and jobs) without needing to be sponsored. This option is very attractive for me because I literally have zero industry experience (no internships) due to having spent my time studying quantitative stuff in the later years of my undergraduate. Therefore, if I choose Oxford, I will apply for this visa and try to get some data analyst internships in the UK after graduation. In addition, Oxford's tuition is much cheaper than Harvard's (expected total cost is approximately $63K)

&amp;#x200B;

Harvard 

 [Master's in Data Science | Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://seas.harvard.edu/applied-computation/graduate-programs/masters-data-science) 

Harvard's program is pretty rigorous. It is part of the engineering department and lasts for 1.5 years. The curriculum is certainly more appealing than that of Oxford because I believe I can definitely learn all the quantitative things needed to become an entry-leve data scientist. However, there are some serious problems.

First, Harvard' program is extremely expensive. It is approximately twice more expensive than the total cost of attending Oxford. Very sad that there aren't funding opportunities, but I guess that's to be expected from masters programs in the US. Although my parents will be funding my studies (eternally grateful to them and I know many around the world aren't able to receive funding from their parents) it doesn't change the fact that it's a lot of financial burden. 

Second, it will be almost impossible for me to get industry experience. I know that many international students use masters programs to get a job in the US and stay there, but for an international student who has no prior work experience and no undergraduate STEM degree, I know that for such a competitive field it will be very difficult to even acquire an internship in the US, much less a full time job. And visa rules in the US require you to get a job in 3 months after graduating in a related field (for me it would be data science/analytics) or else you need to go back to your home country. Therefore, it is very likely that I will be returning to my home country with just the masters degree and no internship. I don't know if this will help me get a job even back in my country. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some things to note:

I am not desperate to stay in a particular country to work there - I am perfectly fine with going back to my own country after graduation. However, I really wish to get some experience (internships) before going back, so that I can maximize my chances of getting a lucrative job in my country. Also, I am aware that entry level data scientist positions are almost non-existent these days and everybody seems to start out as a data analyst. I'm fine with this, because in my country a masters degree in a quantitative subject is required to become even a data analyst, much less a data scientist.  My current career goal is to be hired as a data analyst in a large company for my first job. Currently, Oxford's program is more appealing in that regard due to its lower costs and the opportunity to get some internships in the UK after graduation. 

However, my family and friends are are telling me to go to Harvard, because apparently the 'brand value' of Harvard exceeds that of Oxford's in our country, on top of the fact that it is more rigorous. Also they are making it sound like I can just go for a phd if you can't get internships in the US after graduation (which I think is a bit ridiculous because I'm not even thinking of a phd right now, and phds are not things you can get just because you want to). Yeah the sentiment here is a bit America-centric and they all prefer masters degrees from the US (I personally do not think Oxford's brand value is worse than that of Harvard's but oh well). 

&amp;#x200B;

Based on this, I am stuck in a dilemma. I really don't know which university to choose and both sound seriously appealing to me. For people working as data analysts or data scientists (preferably working in the UK and US right now) or people that know a lot about either of the programs, I would really appreciate your opinions and advice. Where should I go based on my circumstances?",Having a very hard time choosing my masters programs. Would appreciate some advice.,datascience
"I love both data science and economics and am planning to take a double major in data science and economics at university. However, many people are telling me that the 2 majors don't go well together and that there are not many fields that would require economics knowledge in the data science industry. I would like to know the opinion of data science professionals on whether an economics background (particularly the mods with more mathematical rigour) is useful in data science in general. Also, I would love to hear if there are any data scientists working in the economics sector (ie. in the government). It seems that data scientist roles where economics actively comes into play are quite limited.

If you are a hiring manager looking for a junior data scientist role, would you hire someone with an econs and data science double major as opposed to someone who has a full data science degree and has taken more math and stats mods?

I work on a company that builds software solutions for governments. At the data sector, we are processing healthcare data for BI and ML applications. 

Our current data pipeline looks something like this: Oracle db (data source) -&gt; PostgreSQL db (intermediate db) -&gt; Power BI. This workflow is orchestrated by AirFlow.

The main issue we are facing is the control of which person can access which database, and the segmentation of said data.

We would also like to implement a data governance tool. I have been looking into Delta Lake, but it seems this is a tool for data lake house, and not data governance.

Hello my friends!

I am a last semester undergrad mathematics student and now that I will no longer be enrolled in college, the thought of my future as a mathematician has been haunting me. As you know, the mathematical life can be very lonely, and I only have a couple of friends and professors to whom I can talk about mathematics.

So, I wanted to hear some advice from fellow experienced STEM wokers who can give me some insight. To give some context I also have a degree in electronic engineering and in my mathematical journey I have been very focused on model theory and logic, but lately after finishing my thesis I discovered that maybe the academia life is not for me. So I have taken two courses on actuarial mathematics and mathematical finance (which I enjoyed a lot). In engineering, I only liked the signal processing/dynamical systems/machine learning courses (which was one of the reasons why I decided to double major in math).

Right now, I feel that life as an academic is not what I'm looking for in life (specially in the country I live in) and that my love for mathematics has been more of a love for challenges and learning new things (rather than mathematics by itself) and I am very passionate about solving problems and mathematics has become sort of a drug giving me dopamine rushes every time something 'clicks' or every time I solve a problem. So that is why I am looking or advice in jobs that have a deep mathematical component that offers challenges every day and that evolves constantly (that also offers good payment and work/life balance). So far these are my options with their pros and cons:

* Quant /Mathematical finance: **Pros**: I love the deep and complex structure of the stock market and I feel that it has rich mathematical problems (stochastic calculus, PDE's, programming, etc.) It also offers great payment and looks like a very active lifestyle. **Cons:** I don't like that the main purpose is money driven. I have also heard that it is extremely time-consuming and that the there is not much work/life balance.
* Data Analyst/Data miner: **Pros:** I love programming. It also offers rich mathematical techniques and can be applied to a vast number of scenarios. I like that it is not tied to a specific industry because pretty much every enterprise needs data analysis in today's world. **Cons:** I have read that the day-to-day work is very different from the theory, and you end up being an advisor to the sales team on a company that expects you to do magic with their data. I also feel that climbing up the salary ladder takes longer.
* Actuary: **Pros:** Great payment. Great work/life balance (from what I have read). There are not a lot of actuaries. **Cons:** The need to take so many exams/certifications to increase salary/position. Work becomes very monotone and I feel that you are tied to the insurance market. Spreadsheet boring life.
* Programmer/software developer: **Pros:** fantastic salary (you can find home office work in USD). Already have experience programming. High demand for software developers. **Cons:** not very math-focused. It depends **a lot** on *what* you are programming. (I see programmers as digital construction workers), I would love some machine learning/math related programming, but I would die f boredom developing web-pages and that sort of stuff.

Can you guys share some of your experiences in these fields? How do you see each career in the future? Do you have any other recommendations for me? Thank you so much in advance.

In a nut shell I got the impression that the job was primarily dashboarding. I mentioned I’m currently learning and working on ML problems and that’s what I want to continue doing. So the consensus was that there’s nothing that’s I’d be interested in now but as they build out their BI dept something will eventually pop up.

A. Get a year under my belt with my current company and work on personal projects that will help a future application with Company B.

"I'm not a data scientist but I may or may not have to work on a project that leans into the subject. Basically we have a a bunch of databases with measurements and I'm supposed to write a tool that reads it in processes it and visualizes it in python.

But the more I read about it the more I realize that if I want to code this in python and have it be efficient, I'll need to use as little python as possible. Its no secret that python is a lot slower than say C but apparently there is also this global lock thing (GIL) which is gonna cause a huge performance loss when trying to parallelize my code unless I stuff everything into frameworks built in C.

"Hey all, [repost](https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/10wngpx/comment/j7oe976/?context=3) from r/careeradvice as I got recommended to get your guy's opinion on this.

For context, last May I graduated with my bachelor's in CS. During that time I was part of an undergraduate research group and I really enjoyed it. I was able to get 2 publications (conferences) at the time and felt like I was doing a lot.

By the time I was graduating, the school was starting a new data science PhD program. Since I really enjoyed the research experience, I applied and was accepted, such that I was skipping my master's degree and doing a PhD directly. I've always wanted to do a PhD.

Now I am in my first year of my PhD, and now I am a bit anxious that the fact that I will have a degree for both my bachelor's and PhD are from the same university.

For you to know, I do not plan to go into academia after my PhD, I plan to work directly in the industry as a data scientist.

Relative newbie to data science, although I come from a sciencey background. 

I'm trying to get experience wiith using databases and production-type scripts (rather than Jupyter notebooks), so I am trying to scrape data from websites and store it in the AWS ecosystem, specifically in an S3 bucket and putting it in to a database (RDS or Athena).

However, reading any AWS documentation or even makes me feel like I'm in /r/VXJunkies; I know what some of the words mean, I guess, but they just don't make any sense. Reading code code documentation and understanding how to move files to a database...it's not comfortable at first, but it feels like progress the more you learn, and generally I can get it working. In my case, using Python and boto3 to create a database from a csv file. 

But then there are permission errors, and reading something like [""There is an additional public and private subnet in a separate Availability Zone. An RDS DB subnet group requires a subnet in at least two Availability Zones. The additional subnet makes it easy to switch to a Multi-AZ DB instance deployment in the future.""](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.Scenarios.html)...is just...like, what.

I also tried moving files from an s3 bucket to an Athena bucket using a Glue crawler and generally had no idea what was going on.

Any tips for getting over that initial hump in this side of the field?

It did stress me a bit because I dont think I will be a fit for their culture. + its a 1 hour drive each direction so it will be hard, and I dont want to waste time and not enjoy there and being not motivated to come to work.

I watched some courses on statistics to try actually understand some concept like probability and especially harmonic mean lol, learnt SQL but never got to know how I'd use SQL to actually get data from a database anf use it for modeling. 2 years later, I honestly don't even know what am doing anymore, I wake up, log in to kaggle, find an interesting dataset, formulate a problem that might need solving (no matter how ridiculous it is) and do some analysis or build a model, and by the end of the day I contemplate whether what am doing is enough to actually land a job in the coming years.

"Hi all. 

Some context: My background is in engineering (not data science). I work at a manufacturing plant as a process engineer. Although my background is not in data, a bulk of the work I do in my current role involves analyzing large datasets to identify defect trends and rectify quality issues. I learned python, JMP on the job and use these for data visualization and statistical analysis.

The problem: my process involves making (cutting) multiple parts out of a single ingot. The parts are cut simultaneously. A single ingot can yield up to 7 parts. The process takes about 5 hrs. The machine records data of key machine parameters (inputs) every 5 seconds. So, each cut (production run) produces about 3600 rows of data from ~10 different parameters.

At the end of a cut, each part is inspected on a CMM for surface features. When I plot the readings of the surface features of each part from each cut on a time series graph, I notice that the surface feature readings tend to drift with time (variability between cuts). I want to know what is causing the drift. 

What I need help with: I want to know if there is a correlation between a certain machine parameter and the surface readings. I have 3600 data points from my input and 7 data points from my output compared over n number of production runs. This is a lot of data to deal with and it is very difficult to draw any conclusions from such a comparison. Is there a way to simplify the analysis?

The problem is that it is the only model I made and I would like to try more things to show to my interviewer. Some thoughts:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I thought about making a traditional linear regression to compare LightGBM with but the data they gave does not hold the assumptions of a linear model (i.e. residuals not normally dist.)
2. I thought about XGBoost but, as far as I know, its performance is similar to LightGBM but LightGBM is faster and uses less memory
3. Neural networks are not even considered given the size of the dataset

The instructions of the case say that the company is not so well interested in the prediction itself. They explicit say that the approach used to solve the task is more important than the prediction, especially because the data was randomly generated. In this case should I stress with making more models?

I then used a roberta model finetunned for sentiment analysis on tweets ([https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest)) and it got 57% accuracy out of the box. Mind you that this is a 3 class classification task.

The cool thing about my project is that it uses active learning to recommend tweets for someone to label with the goal of getting a better model with the least amount of labeled tweets possible. So using the training set I labeled 40 tweets and got my accuracy on the test set up to 66% - a 9% increase in accuracy because I labeled 40 tweets. Now my question is: is that good?

The model I used was already finetunned for sentiment analysis and I just further fine tuned it. the training loop looks something like: the active learning policy asks a user to label 8 tweets (this is the batch size) and once they are labeled it updates the model and uses that model to recommend another 8 tweets for a user to label.

The number doesn't really sound good enough to add to my resumé, but tbh I was surprised I got that improvement because there are a lot of tweets about Elon Musk that are hard to label, even for a human....",Did I just waste my time with this project?,datascience

"Hi, I am new to the world of DS / DE / DA. I have my BS in Materials Science, and spent 4 years in industry doing manufacturing and R&amp;D, which required stats based data analysis and report writing.

I switched to a backend Software dev job 5 months ago where my team builds ETL pipelines. Soon I will be rotating to a new team as I'm in a trainee program. Although I don't have control over where I'm placed, I will be applying to transfer to one of our Data Engineering teams. The main reason I switched over to a Software job was because I realized I enjoy analyzing data and this rotational program was my foot in the door. 

Now, I'm experiencing a lot of imposter syndrome because I don't have a CS degree and feel like I need to go back to school asap for a Master's in CS or Data Science.

"Hi All,  
So here is some background. I graduated in Dec 2021 with BSCS (3.7 GPA). I accepted an offer at a Bank as System Analyst (mostly doing Project management and writing queries for reporting).

So far the salary is good, great benefits and it's a remote job. I only work 4hrs a day and my bosses are pretty happy with my performance. Rest of my day I just learn backend stuff, LC practices, or some cooking videos.

Lately, I am thinking about going back to school part-time for MS in DS, or something else. My company can pay 4k per year for a master's so why not utilize it? I saw a few job postings at my company for DS jobs which motivates me towards this.

I am thinking to apply @ UIUC for the MCS DS program, as it's just an hour away and has a good reputation.

**So here are some questions:**

* **Are there any other self-paced well reputed schools for MS?**
* **Finally, if you have any other advice which you might think I should know then please let me know.**
* **Are there internships for the DS role? (When I was in college I hardly saw any DS internships)** 

My focus is to get as many DS internships within the company or outside of the company, and what I've noticed is most companies don't offer internships unless one is enrolled in school and pursuing BS, MS, or Ph.D.

"Pretty much the title.

Currently I'm learning Java on my own. I like math and statistics, i can understand the logic and can write the pseudocode but it takes me forever due to errors in syntax and language structure. I use chatGPT for help in understanding pretty elementary concepts like polymorphism, inheritance etc. About 90% of my time is spent debugging my code. I don't find the concepts themselves difficult just how everything is structured.


And end of the day I only see coding as a tool to be used to break down a bigger picture. I don't find the point in learning about the code for the sake of coding itself. Its like being overly focused on power tools when your goal is to build a house. Yeah j need them but i dont find it nessacary to learn all the nitty hritty of every single power tool there is unless i am a power tool manufacturer. I'm also mot the kind of coder who would ""play around"" with code for the most optimal implementation and runtime or do hackathons in my free time. Really at heart I don't think I am a ""software developer"".



My interests lie primarily in math,stats and econcomics/finance. That's the stuff I really enjoy and ""coding"" is just a tool to use for me to better tackle those domains. I would much rather be a Quant rather then a software developer.



So all that pretty much put me off software engineering and for now and I'm considering data sceicne cause I think it'd be better suited as it is more math heavy and it has applications instead of developemnt of some tool.


However reading this subreddit, tells me that coding is absolutely essential part of you're job and basiclly you are just becoming a software engineer. How much of this is true? How much of your time is spent really doing the basic software development coding tasks like debugging and what not and how much of you're time is spent really ""analyzing data""?


I really want to get a clear picture of really HOW software works here.


TLDR: I like the math, data and logic but hate the entire software development process(debugging optimization etc) only see software as a tool towards a greater goal. Not the kind fo guy who develops apps or does hackathons on his free time. I would much rather be a Quant then a software developer.

"So a bit of background, I finished a PhD in OR in late 2020 and started working for large US-based retailer as a Data/AI Scientist. The job is great and focuses on optimization more than ML which is perfect for my background and interests. I make less than I could if I shifted to a silicon valley company, but the benefits are excellent, I have full time remote, and the work life balance is way better than when I worked at one of the FAANG companies. Bottom line is that I'm in no hurry to leave where I am. 

With that being said, I do want to move up into management in the next few years so I can run my own research team. I know I can do that much without an MBA, but I don't think I can move much higher. I'm also not sure whether or not I want to. 

Unfortunately while I'm not currently sure whether I want the type of job that would actually require an MBA, now would be the ideal time to do it: my wife will be finishing her PhD soon and we'll probably want to start having kids in the next couple years once she has a stable (non-post doc) job so that won't be a good time to start working on a new degree.

- how often do you need to change the train
- how long would a car commute be certain specific areas. If train is not sufficient 
- how is the bike infrastructure in that city
- how hilly is that area? (Bad for bikes)
- which car sharing option does that city have if any?
- schools, kindergarden, etc.
- is there public transportation in that city?
- is there a swimming pool in a reasonable distance?
- How is the internet? (I work remote and my SO partially. Internet in Germany is a joke)

"It is a basic binary image classification problem, where there is good/bad parts on a production line. 

There is a 5% error margin for missclassifying good parts into bad. However,  I cannot missclassify one single bad sample as a good one. It was supposed to be a simple project, but a 6 month projects became a 18 month old project where there is always one image that does not pass this insane requirement.

I got tired of explaining that there is no way that I can assure, that the model will never miss at least one image to both the client and to my boss. I have tried N approaches and models, that although I can achieve a 100% accuracy on my validation set, all that it need is a one single missclassified sample to hold me from delivering the project. 

My strategy now is to develop a documentation and explain to the client of the statistical difficulties  that invalidate this requirement.

"I quite don’t know where to start. I have like partial knowledge in a lot of areas : I get the general idea behind an SVM for instance (create a hyperplan in a n-dimension space that separates the data), I know that Linear Regression involves fitting a line that minimizes the error between predicted values and real values. I get that Ridge and Lasso penalize non-important coefficients as to reduce overfitting. That decision tree are comprised of if/else questions, that separates the data until it can predict a feature. That Random Forest involves creating a lot of different decision trees, in which the decision is taken by making trees to ""vote"". That boosting involves correcting previous decisions’ tree by fitting on their residuals. I get that PCA involves a dimensionality reduction, in the sense that’s the features are getting squished for explaining most of their variance (not really sure about this though).

But the thing is that I know only glimpses of everything. The math behind all those models were never my forte : I still have trouble to picture vectors, or matrices, for instance. I struggle to translate equations to graphical plots. I tend to disregard mathematical equations, if they involve too many symbols (like two sigma signs next to each other). I get the intuition behind most models, but I have trouble to vulgarize them, as I am not mastering them. Recent example ? I had a technical interview, and the recruiter asked me to describe in layman terms how a PCA works. I stuttered an answer, saying that it’s reducing dimensionality and features, but I was feeling (and the recruiter was surely sensing it too), that I was kinda lost. 

Are there some other people in my shoes ? If so, how did you tackle this limitation, and where can I find any good statistical/algebra courses on all those models, that going from the *very very* beginning to the most complex stuff ?

I got into my grad program with the bare minimum (Calc 1-2, a bit of linear algebra), which made life pretty tough but I managed to graduate.

Now that I’m working full time and have a family (and some hobbies to preserve my sanity), my time is VERY limited, so learning something like the equivalent of a full undergrad degree worth of math isn’t possible. I’m thinking of just making sure I solidify my calculus and linear algebra background, basically the equivalent of finishing the standard calc sequence.

"I work in Computer Vision and other Deep Learning areas, and I've noticed a startlingly fast rise of really good Chinese CV research.

FAIR and Google and a few others still have some of the best work out there, but the Chinese are really really beginning to dominate.

Look at CVPR, out of the 2000 accepted papers, 90% have some Chinese origin. That's just by glancing and I could definitely be counting a lot of American or foreign Chinese immigrants, but it's at a minimum 75%.

My questions about this are:

1. Is there work really innovative? As far as I can tell most of their work is iterative improvements on existing western research, most.....definitely NOT all.
2. Will this trend lead to China dominating and forging ahead in AI?
3. They depend on US open-sourced libraries (PyTorch mainly) and hardware (NVIDIA, Intel/AMD). However, I do know China is investing in GPU startups and right now they pale in comparison to NVIDIA's best, but like everything coming out of China, it takes a few years before they become level with leading western tech. Also, PaddlePaddle is becoming quite a good library that can compete with PyTorch. Is the headstart by the West maintainable?
4. Is this going to become part of the cold war almost like a space race, but concerning AI and tech? I mean, it's probably inevitable, but my main concern is how does this affect what becomes open-sourced. I know licenses can be somewhat effective, but in a cold war scenario no one is going to enforce and adheres to license agreements
5. Where does this leave western (US/UK/EU/Japan/Korea) tech giants? It's inevitable that China, in 10 years, will become dominant in tech in many areas. How would that affect the marketshare, control and dominance of western tech?
6. What's going on with India? I had an NVIDIA colleague who claimed (5 years ago) that India was going to revolutionize and dominate AI research. That definitely has NOT happened and China has exceeded everyone's expectations. Does India have the potential to catch up?

"I just received a take-home test after a phone screen &amp; HM interview for a startup.

1. The question is not trivial. I got 7 MB of .csv data with 3 tables and hundreds of thousands of rows. They're asking me a nebulous question (describe any patterns you see and give business recommendations) and there's no time limit given. They also want a PowerPoint presentation.
2. I asked the HM for examples of projects I would work on if hired, and he gave me one example that they need to work on. Lo and behold this is exactly the project he was describing.

I suspect that they might be making me work for free. I got burned by a similarly complicated interview question in the past, where I diligently spent 12+ hours giving recommendations on the business use case, DNN architectures, etc., and got ghosted immediately after... also at a small startup.

"Hey All,

I just got my first job offer after searching for over 6 months after finishing a data science bootcamp last December. They are offering me an 80K base salary, with some sort of opportunity for a 3% performance bonus (I asked for more info on this and haven't heard back yet), 10 paid holidays and 10 vacation days annually (this will be prorated for my first year). Pretty standard benefits (medical, dental, vision, 401k, life insurance, disability, etc.) and some others I hadn't seen before: Hyatt Legal support, Critical Illness and Accident Insurance ( both Employee Paid), and a vacation buy plan where I can pay some of my salary to take up to 5 additional vacation days.

Some things I noticed that were slightly worse then some other companies I've interviewed at: The 401k match is a 2.5% match as opposed to a typical 3% match, and the 10 vacation days a year feel like a lot less compared to some companies that have 20ish or unlimited PTO.

For the above reasons I feel like I should try to negotiate a higher salary, however I'm nervous about doing so and the offer possibly being rescinded (I'm running out of savings and have a 5 month old infant). So I have a couple questions I hoped you all could answer:

Have any of you ever had an offer rescinded for trying to negotiate a better salary/benefits package?

Am I off-base at all with the vacation time?

Are there other parts of the package besides salary that I should consider negotiating too?

Thanks in advance for the help.

Edit to add more info: I live in northern Colorado, the position is fully remote and with an aerospace and defense IT consulting and IT services engineering company based in Cincinnati, OH. The current salary is already significantly more than I have ever made.

Edit 2: Forgot to mention that I undervalued myself early in the interview process and gave a salary range of 60-80K. So from their perspective its possible they may feel they are already giving me a great offer because of how I anchored think early on.

Edit 3: Since people keep asking I did General Assembly's Data Science Immersive (their word for bootcamp). I might write up a review on this at a later date, but overall I think it was good. I don't really know what other bootcamps are like, but GA provided a fair bit of job prep during the program and a good amount of job search/job rec support after the program. For additional background I have a BA in Psychology, an MA in Educational Psychology, and was 2/3 of the way to a Ph.D. in Educational Psychology (just had comps and a couple courses left before dissertation).

Edit 4/Final Edit: Holy cow! I did not expect to get this many responses/comments on this post. Thank you to everyone who took time to give advice and add your perspective to my situation. It really has blown me away how helpful everyone here has been, and it makes me even more excited to be joining this community!

I went back and forth on whether or not to try and negotiate some part of this offer, but I ultimately made the decision to simply accept it as is and plan to learn and grow in this position and then look at another job/renegotiate my compensation after 6 months-a year. I realize that the likelihood of them rescinding the offer is incredibly low, but getting an extra 5-10K or an extra vacation day is not equivalent to losing this offer after I've been job searching for over 6 months. I also have an infant to think about as well and I can't imagine the pain and fear I would feel if this got revoked. 

Yes I realize I'm making the cautious decision, but it feels like the best decision for me and my family right now to ensure that I have financial stability and an entrance into this industry. That is worth much more to me than a salary increase. 

It seemed like a couple of people were interested in hearing more about my background and experience with GA's Data Science Immersive, so I will probably do a write-up/review of it at some point in the next week or o before I start my new position.

Again thank you all for your advice, support, and congratulations it really means a lot to me to know this many people wanted to help me as I'm entering this field!","First Job Offer after 6 months of job searching, nervous to negotiate",datascience

"This question is about computational efficiency for natural language text preprocessing. Probably not the ideal sub for this, but I've struck out everywhere else, and I really need help. So here goes nothing...

# TL;DR

I need help selecting between `spacy` and `sklearn` for processing a huge text corpus. I ran a test to measure the performance of each, but the results were unexpected. Moreover, because I'm new-ish to the frameworks involved, I lack confidence that my test is completely valid. I'd really appreciate some guidance.

- [Code](https://pastebin.com/dBAW1rrD)

- [Results](https://imgur.com/a/dhJmNGi)

# Background

I'm doing a project that involves preprocessing 35 million Reddit comments. This is a pretty massive amount of text. So I'm searching for the most efficient framework to accomplish this with.

Currently, I am considering using either `spacy`’s `nlp.pipe` with several custom components, or a `sklearn.Pipeline` with a ton of regex-based data transformers. Since (1) `spacy` is optimized for text and (2) regex in Python is slow, I figured the `spacy` option is the way to go. But I wanted to test my assumptions before proceeding.

# The test

[So I wrote a quick and dirty script to do just that.](https://pastebin.com/dBAW1rrD) It seems like a lot of code at first skim, but it's actually not. It's very modular, mostly consisting of simple classes. Skip to `if __name__ ...` at the end to see the overall logic.

Anyway, this script defines what I *think* are broadly equivalent pipelines, one `spacy`-based and one `sklearn`-based, that simply remove (1) punctuation and (2) inline code `like this`. These pipelines subclass an additional class which actually carries out the test. So the script loads a ~7.5k-comment sample from this sub as a `dask.dataframe` (for parallelization), applies the same preprocessing 100 times using each pipeline, then averages out the results.

To be clear, my actual pipeline will do several more things than just remove punctuation and inline code. I only chose those for testing purposes, to keep my tests simple and to the point.

# Results

My findings (in seconds) are as follows, illustrated graphically [here](https://imgur.com/a/dhJmNGi):

|pipeline|mean|standard dev|
|:-:|-:|-:|
|`spacy`|13.49772|1.182763|
|`sklearn`|6.853291|0.127701|

Clearly, `spacy` was massively slower. This contradicted my expectations, and leaves me unable to draw firm conclusions.

Is `sklearn.Pipeline` with regex truly the more efficient framework for this? Or was there an issue with my test, or how I structured my pipelines? The latter seems plausible because almost everything the script uses is new-ish to me - `dask.dataframe`, `spacy` with custom components, and `sklearn.Pipeline` with custom transformers. So it may very well be that e.g., I'm just using `spacy` wrong, or there's something about my script that renders the comparison apples to oranges instead of apples to apples.

# Cry for help

In light of this uncertainty, I'd sincerely appreciate some input from anyone familiar with these frameworks. I'd also appreciate some eyes on my code, if possible, just to check that I've actually used everything properly.

Any and all input is welcome. Thank you!",Why does sklearn.Pipeline with regex outperform spacy for text preprocessing?,datascience

I accepted my current role 2 years ago out of desperation, just when COVID started and economies were plummeting, The company is a small data mediation and fraud management company. and I was tasked to kickstart ML/AI in the company, being the sole ML person other than my supervisor who only knew high-level concepts (mind you I was a fresh grad back then), I did achieve several milestones, and learnt a lot in terms of programming, software engineering and the ML stuff, but our ML feature never really left the presales stage, and the largest dataset I've dealt with was only 1mil rows in size.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today, I just searched up the job postings related to MLE and every company is posting freaking long lists of requirements, half of which I never touched throughout my 2 years. These include

\- Cloud Platforms (GCP, AWS)

\- Data orchestration and pipelines (Apache Airflow)

\- MLOps platforms (Kubeflow, MLFLow)

\- Containerisation (Docker/K8)

Not to mention, these MLE job posting pretty rare in the country that I work in, so I'm competing against many who, with a search of 'MLE' on LinkedIn, seem to have all the requirements just fine, along with 5 - 6 projects under their belt with similar years of experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I didn't really achieve a lot during my 2 years. Granted, I can't say that I have been 100% diligent, but I feel like there's only so much you can do being the sole person in the company working on ML. The ML feature that I've been working on from the ground up is indeed end-to-end (with multiprocessed model serving, model monitoring, auto model retraining, good explainability etc.), but at the same time it feel like it's lacking so much (no scalability with containers and clusters, not deployed in cloud, not using MLOps platforms like Kubeflow, not really proven in production). And I only really have 1 projects to show for my 2 years of experience.

&amp;#x200B;

That's when the imposter syndrome really kicks in and I start questioning myself. Can I really keep up? There are so many things to learn. Is this really what I want to do? TBH I feel like I'm also a bit sick of ML. I realised I don't really like analytics and the stats part of ML. I don't hate it, but I'm not sure that I have the passion to keep up. Or maybe I'm just burnt out temporarily, idk. The only part of ML that I find interest in right now is the software engineering side, productionalising ML, and computer vision in general.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I've decided to tender my resignation and start spending some time upskilling again. I'm currently looking at either Data Engineering or continue towards MLE/MLOps side of things. Even though I have no real experience/interest with DE, I'd figure that the job market with DE is relatively good right now compared to MLE in my third world country, and the job doesn't seem as difficult as MLE. I will have to learn some things from the ground up for DE though.

TLDR: Should I go for MLE again after patching up some of my shortcomings in tools/skills? Or should I dig deep into Computer Vision, maybe even get a Masters? Or should I give up and settle for DE?  
Also, are those job requirements above really realistic?

I appreciate any advice that anyone can give. And thanks for reading this huge block of text for a stranger on the internet.",Should I transition from MLE to DE? Rant/experience sharing from a 2 YOE MLE with imposter syndrome,datascience

"I am going from an ML Researcher role(medium company, low pay) to a DS role in a big company. Is this the end of my ML journey? Will I be doing dashboards, queries and presentations only? Does Data Science does not actually involve ML at all? I tried asking all these questions before accepting the offer but they couldn't answer because it was the first time this team was being formed at this location and I will be directly reporting to the US team. 

Honestly, the main reason I am switching from research profile to DS is because I wanted to learn the end-to-end ML pipeline, from data base to deployment in production for real products. Is that supposed to be an MLE job?

I am trying to keep an open mind and let go of my ego for having worked with DL models and looking down upon my friends who do linear regression in big companies. But seeing the comments here, I will be happy even if I get to do ANY ML at all.

"I have been working in the same company for the last 4 years. It's a medium sized company (about 150 employees) and my department it's a small one (around 10 people).

Originally my position was ""data scientist"", but we are a consulting company and have both projects for clients and our own products.

Because the complexity of the projects is not absurdly extreme we started doing our own data engineer/cloud tasks too and it has improved the department in speed and quality.

This is some of the tasks I do:


- Build ETL
- Design AWS architectures
- Configure and design CI/CD for devops
- Data exploration
- Model creation
- ML experiments design
- Monitoring software/models

"TL;DR using plotly for entire database analytics and making PDF reports to replace excel 

The context here is long, horrifying, and kind of funny, but this might interest some. So my company has a few hundred clients that load data a few times a year and pay for analytics reports. Ok fine, just use airflow to ETL the transactions onto an analytical db, do whatever regressions/averages/percentiles you need to, use Looker to pull tables and figures into csv, xlsx, pdfs, web dashboard, whatever.  But no - management keeps hiring analysts (me) to do the following: manually query SQL, copy and paste up to 8 different select statements into an excel doc that takes up to 45 minutes to open, then print tabs to PDF for as many reports as a client orders (the client only gets an analytics report as a PDF). The only programming project management hesitantly sanctioned were xlwings scripts to semi automatically adjust column widths and zooms to prettify margins and charts before auto printing to directories. 

Enter me. I suggested early on that a dashboarding tool could render analytics for the high throughput reporting products with lower resistance and better quality. People looked at me like I had three heads, especially the seniors. This is my first job so as a learning project I just slowly built a chunky plotly dashboard for my localhost. I also had to build an underlying ETL pipeline in SQL and pandas for generating csv views from the db and putting them into folders for each client. And since the original product was a PDF, I made a GUI for writing the dashboard tables and figures to stylized latex tables, and pdf images to be combined into a LaTeX PDF with my local installation of MikTex. This last part really stretched me mentally because I don’t really consider myself a front end person who knows html, css, or latex styling very well. Also it feels like plotly wasn’t really designed to programmatically render PDF reports but maybe Overleaf just oversimplified my past LaTeX projects. 

Yes I know I just made a crude/open source-y version of Looker. I’m traumatized and want to scream into the void.",I pushed plotly dash to its breaking point to overhaul an absurdly slow data analysis system.,datascience

This week, I was offered a promotion to lead the AI team that works in this project. I am beyond flattered and of course I said yes, but I do realize that career progression is usually not that fast.

"I've got a black box that takes in 11 bits of input, and spits out 7 output bits. While not positive, I believe that the output is a strict function of the input.  

I can observe this black box in action, collecting real world data of inputs and the associated outputs. I don't believe that all 2^11 inputs are possible in the real world.... so far across millions of samples, I'm seeing about 500 unique inputs.  

How can I determine and define the black box function?  

At the minimum, I could create a lookup table with 2048 entries, further refining and verifying entries as I go. But I believe there's a fairly simple relationship of boolean operations, like AND, OR, NOT and so on.  

I'd like to be able to visualize the correlation and ""see"" relationships like ""every time bit 1 is high, the output is all ones."" or ""the only time bit 2 is low on the output is when no bits are high on the input.""  

Karnaugh maps come to mind to take this truth table and minimize it, but at least a few of my sources indicate that 6-input maps are about the maximum. The software solutions I've seen go up to about (8).  

So what software, algorithms, books, etc should I be looking into solve this problem?",Visualizing input and output data to determine black box function,datascience

"I have a toy dataset that has a number of features. Some features have continuous values, others are one-hot encoded. I've set around 1% of each feature to be NaN to test different imputation methods with, such as sklearn's KNNImputer

The one-hot encoded features are treated as continuous values, which means instead of being assigned to 1 or 0, they're getting the average of their neighbors (e.g. if the three closest neighbors' values are \[0,1,1\], the imputed value will be .66).

What is the best practice for this? Snap the values to the nearest class (e.g. anything above .5 is rounded up to 1, anything below is 0)?  Am I only supposed to use KNN on continuous features? Very interested in hearing from others.

"Hello DS folks,

I work in an airline trying to train models to predict demand of our flights routes.

Regardless of post/during COVID times which are a total mess in terms of applying predictions based on history, I'm trying to find a general approach to use both local calendar (for example Jewish/Islamic/Christian Holidays which only relevant for specific portion of the population), and the Global/Gregorian which clearly affects the whole aviation industry around the world.Example: Chiasmas is always on the same Gregorian date every year while Hanukah may shift few days forwards/backswords every year ETC)Also, the differences between some solar calendar and lunar calendars (like the Islamic/Jewish calendars) is something to consider.

The current ""solution"":

I've got a manual ""dictionary"" (done by a colleague), matching between some dates in history (for example 2019 and more pre-covid times) and the current upcoming holidays of 2022/2023.I find this method super naïve and wrong as this process relays too much on a human ""hunch"" about which week this year resembles a week from the past. (Although human experienced in this industry could be helpful sometimes as data could get noisy, and some tasks do benefits the ""good enough"" solutions)

My question:

What is a more accurate and scientific method to deal with history data being inconsistent due to having more than one calendar which affects the business?

My first thoughts are having both calendars as features, and then to feature engineer some more constructive information regarding holidays (examples: days apart from next holiday/ is it a holiday week/weekend of any calendar).Hopefully I'll find a model which could find useful relations between the dates, so any date in the future will be more meaningful regarding its relative time in the year which clearly affects demand.

I wish to hear your thoughts on how to frame this task. Maybe how this is done in other industries/domains.

Thank you!",How to optimize and train models working with both local and global calendars,datascience

"I'm working on a personal project, and I realise I may be in need of learning some data science.

The project scrapes product data from certain websites, and based on the product scraped, simpler versions of the product which can encompass multiple products are created. Lets say the product was 'Long Life Full Fat Milk' - this would translate to 'Milk', containing the different subcategories 'Long Life' and 'Full Fat'. The product itself is then added to 'Milk' under those categories.

Now imagine I have 100k products all of which need to be processed in the same way, to eventually create a database where a general term for a product houses multiple products under it. 

I've been doing this by hand, created a gui to make it easier, but the decisions are endless, it takes a long period to go through a little, and decision fatigue is real.

I can't think of a way to automate this - the decisions are heavily intuition based, sometimes the product name does not detail the full information about the item, so assessing a picture of the product is necessary, often there is branding &amp; unnecessary detail included in the product name which needs to be removed to translate it to a more general category it falls under.

I'm not very familiar with data science, currently I organise the data on a gui to make it as clear as possible to process it manually, but I honestly don't see an alternative approach to this.

"I am working on a side project called `byod-hub` (BYOD = Bring Your Own Device) to let people pool multiple servers (they own) to form a DS platform based on Jupyterhub in minutes.

I think this might be useful to let small-mid-sized DS teams to better utilize their computing resources (e.g., if you have multiple GPU workstations and rely on assigning each one to people to SSH onto, this might be for you) by pooling them and providing a service like Jupyterhub on-top to provide a unified entry point to conduct their work using notebooks. Addons like [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/) and [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) can be added with single-click as well once the platform is up.

I would like to hear about the comments and suggestions from the community. Do you find this potentially useful? Or how should this be built in your opinion?

The general workflow to form such as platform is like this:

A control plane service (that only handles orchestration of computing resources) is first started on one computer (or it can be a hosted service):

```bash
$ byod-hub control-plane start

[INFO] The control plane is starting
[INFO] The control plane is served at https://192.168.2.100

# get the command to register a node
$ byod-hub control-plane get-join-command

[INFO] To join, run the following from a node
[INFO] byod-hub node join --url 192.168.2.100 --token 233asdasd343645gf
```

Then one can run the following command on their own server to register it to the control plane
```bash
$ byod-hub node join --url 192.168.2.100 --token 233asdasd343645gf

[INFO] Registrting node to control plane at 192.168.2.100
[INFO] Registration finished
```

After that, one can visit the URL of the control plane `https://192.168.2.100` to start to use a [Jupyterhub](https://jupyter.org/hub) service to request Jupyter instances.

" Background: I'm more of a Data Analyst / PM in Data Science. I work for a data/analytics company (Vendor side) where I'm 100% dedicated to one client, a sizable global company (\~$14B), but my role is with their US teams.

I've been working with them for nearly 3 years and the relationship and feedback was always positive, transparent, constructive, collaborative, etc. However, 6 months ago a new Director (Client Side), comes in and this completely changes.

\- 1) Feedback now comes indirectly through channels (through my direct boss on Vendor side) not directly from the Client; lack of transparency, collaboration. I'd prefer they just be upfront with me and communicate directly.

\- 2) The feedback continues to be vague and general, and when I ask for specifics, I get a lot of ""They didn't provide any examples"" or ""Well that's their perception."" I'm not one to get defensive; instead, I actually want to know what they're talking about so I can improve on it, but my issue is I don't know what they're talking about (what instances/specifics), so I'm very confused.

\- 3) Despite the fact that I, on my own volition, take the initiative to submit weekly/bi weekly reports to my Client on a) Recently Completed deliverables, b) In Progress Deliverables, and c) Upcoming Deliverables, plus I clearly document everything else I'm working on for them, there seems to be either a lack of acknowledgement or appreciation (in general on stuff I/we deliver, my sense is a clear lack of appreciation).

\- 4) On more than one occasion, I have been accused of either saying or doing something I never said nor did (e.g. someone putting words in my mouth), and this is very unnerving (similar to #2).

What should I do? It's been recurring. I thought at first it would pass but it keeps happening.

"For Seq2Seq deep learning architectures, viz., LSTM/GRU and multivariate, multistep time series forecasting, its important to convert the data to a 3D dimension: (batch\_size, look\_back, number\_features). Here \_look\_back\_ decides the number of past data points/samples to consider using \_number\_features\_ from your training dataset. Similarly, \_look\_ahead\_ needs to be defined which defines the number of steps in future, you want your model to forecast for.

                past, future = data[window_start: past_end, :], data[past_end: future_end, :]

            return np.array(X), np.array(y)

But, \_look\_back\_ and \_look\_ahead\_ are hyper-parameters which need to be tuned for a given dataset.

Vector Representations of Data enable a new tool for Data Scientists to understand their data! For example, let's look at Twitter Analytics!

I want to understand how many impressions a Tweet will get -- an attempt to reverse engineer the recommendation algorithm, as well as the social context as a whole.

Twitter Analytics gives you symbolic attributes such as the Time the tweet was posted or whether the tweet has a URL in it. We can also engineer features from the text of the tweet such as whether it contains an Emoji, or the Word Count.

But this doesn't really capture the meaning of the Tweet and the high-level intuition that is difficult to describe symbolically. This is where Vector Representations come into the picture allowing us to capture the semantics of Tweets purely from the text of the tweet.

Yet, they just dont use them as they prefer to stick to data bricks, spark, sql ect. pretty much connect directly to the data and do their own analysis.

i've proposed to build what ever they need but the idea of switching between data bricks and power bi is a drag to them and they cant seem to be convinced.

do you use any dashboards if so what problems do they solve for you that you couldn't query the data yourself?

What problems do you wish a dashboard could just give you a overview of that would be too long to just build when you need it?

what kind of problems do you encounter weekly that could be solved by having an alert go off or an overview of the problem could help with?",how do i convince data scientists to actually use my power bi dashboards?,datascience

"I graduated with a BS in Chemistry (STEM), worked in pharmaceuticals (1 year) and eventually pivoted to working with hardware (rf/dc) and physics (quantum computing) (5 years).

After taking a python bootcamp, I started to realize how much I liked it and the stars currently align where I'm potentially able to quit my job and spend the next 4 months in a bootcamp and 4-8months after grinding, building my portfolio, and getting the interview in (family = $0 cost). 

Overall, I understand how extremely vigorous the courses are and how it's not something to take lightly. I also know that the job market is saturated and you will probably start as a low paying data analyst / engineer and move your way upwards.

That being said, I'd like to get your thoughts on a few things:

1) Do you think that doing a bootcamp at this current stage is wise, given that another 0.75 interest point hike was just announced and we're pinching our way to a recession?

2) What are the likely fields I'm able to find myself in after graduation, given my experience in STEM in both academia and the workforce?

3) For those who took bootcamps or work with/know people who took bootcamps: What do you/they lack in experience?

For those of you that are farther along in your careers - did having a masters in data science help you? Did it open up other data science positions and was the ROI and time spent on your masters worth it? Is it better to specialize in a program that is more math based or coding heavy?

"I'm trying to learn about and really internalize the different types of distributions, such as the exponential and Poisson distributions as they came up in a probability class I'm taking and I'm just interested in probability in general.  I'm also taking a data science class that's primarily about learning how  use R and Python to analyze data and perform statistical calculations and I wrote a couple simple probability simulations in Python the other day, one simulate the number of coin flips it takes to get tails in a sequence of 5,000 flips (that is, it counts the number of heads flipped until a tail is flipped, saves the value in a list, then resets the counter and starts again, until the loop gets to 5,000 total flips).  The other ran the previous simulation 1,000 times, calculating the ratio of heads to tails for each instance of 5,000 flips.  I had fun with that and I feel like it helped me understand the geometric distribution a lot better (as the first simulation resulted in a histogram with that distribution) much better than problems that just say ""assume this situation follows this distribution and calculate x, y, and z"".  So I want to simulate other experiments that model different different distributions, but I've been having trouble figuring out what types of experiments do that.  

I've been Googling  ""real life examples of exponential probability distribution"" and the like and I get plenty of results but I haven't come across anything I can easily simulate.  For example, one thing that kept coming up was that the time between eruptions of geysers supposedly follows an exponential distribution, but there's no obvious way to simulate that, at least not without knowing something about the geology of geysers, which I don't.  I even tried just finding an actual data set that follows the exponential distribution but didn't have much luck.  I managed to find data on the wait times between eruptions of old faithful, but it turns that distribution isn't even actually exponential, as old faithful is an exception to the general trend with geysers.  I finally thought to look for data on Covid case counts, since epidemics are one of the textbook examples of exponential growth, and I did find that, so that's something, but I'd still to do an actual simulation and I want to look at least one other type distribution of distribution, ideally by doing a simulation.  

Do you have any suggestions for relatively simple experiments I can simulate for this?  Or, failing that, where I can at least find data sets that approximately model such distributions?  I haven't yet learned how to scrape data from websites, as my course doesn't cover it, and I don't have the time to learn it on my own right now (unless it's actually _way_ easier to learn how to do than I'm thinking), so I'd need something where I can just download the data.",What kind of probability experiments can I simulate in Python and/or R whose results follow a distribution other than the normal or geometric distributions?,datascience

"I've been in the data field for 10 years now and gained most of my applied knowledge from my first gig as a BI Developer who was lucky enough to build my own datamart from the ground up for the operations department. Two things that have stuck with me is first the concept of a data grain and what it means you can or can't do with your dataset. Second, for many reasons, is ensuring tables used for metrics are additive. This allows them to work well and accurately as picot tables or with other self service BI tools. Up until now these have been ground rules everywhere I've worked. 

I recently started at a data science shop and these two best practice concepts have been thrown out the window. I feel like people look at me weird if I ask ""what's the grain?"" And get rejected when I propose table designs that are additive. 

Does this stem from the fact data science uses metrics instead of facts &amp; dimensions? Wouldn't it make more sense to build a traditional data wearhouse and then build kpis off of that? 

For example let's say a single row transaction gets used in two different metrics the shop I work for would load that row twice, once with the first metric and again with the other metric number.

"Hi All,

I'm developing projects for a Github portfolio for a job search (lower level data scientist or experienced analyst type of roles for a stats background).  My current project is an R shiny app, and the single threaded nature of it and significant live data updating / computation processing has me looking to split things into server side code execution + SQL data storage + much leaner UI app.   

After spending a couple hours today exploring AWS + Azure VMs, it seems like most of the learning curve is just getting your IDE / software tools up and running + getting comfortable connecting to it -- most of the work seems like a 'setup once reading a guide, then promptly forget most of those details and work as usual over an SSH or RDP'

Based on that, I don't see too much value pursuing AWS VMs (really low memory available on their free boxes), SQL databases, or container hosting much further for my current project.

I was thinking a linear model could work - I get the coefficients and just tweak the variables. For example, *""lets see what happens when we reduce the room temperature to 10 degrees""*. However I have tried a linear regression model and the r-squared is horrific (it's actually negative).

"In the last few weeks I have been interviewing candidates for a graduate DS role. When you look at the CVs (resumes for my American friends) they look great but once they come in and you start talking to the candidates you realise a number of things…
1. Basic lack of statistical comprehension, for example a candidate today did not understand why you would want to log transform a skewed distribution. In fact they didn’t know that you should often transform poorly distributed data. 
2. Many don’t understand the algorithms they are using, but they like them and think they are ‘interesting’. 
3. Coding skills are poor. Many have just been told on their courses to essentially copy and paste code.
4. Candidates liked to show they have done some deep learning to classify images or done a load of NLP. Great, but you’re applying for a position that is specifically focused on regression. 
5. A number of candidates, at least 70%, couldn’t explain CV, grid search. 
6. Advice - Feature engineering is probably worth looking up before going to an interview.

There were so many other elementary gaps in knowledge, and yet these candidates are doing masters at what are supposed to be some of the best universities in the world. The worst part is a that almost all candidates are scoring highly +80%. To say I was shocked at the level of understanding for students with supposedly high grades is an understatement. These universities, many Russell group (U.K.), are taking students for a ride. 

If you are considering a DS MSc, I think it’s worth pointing out that you can learn a lot more for a lot less money by doing an open masters or courses on udemy, edx etc. Even better find a DS book list and read a books like ‘introduction to statistical learning’. Don’t waste your money, it’s clear many universities have thrown these courses together to make money.

Note. These are just some examples, our top candidates did not do masters in DS. The had masters in other subjects or, in the case of the best candidate, didn’t have a masters but two years experience and some certificates. 

Note2. We were talking through the candidates own work, which they had selected to present. We don’t expect text book answers for for candidates to get all the questions right.

"As a student who is currently pursuing a career in Data Science/MLE and with 3 previous intern experiences in a Data Science role, would accepting an internship in a Data Analyst role be a step backwards in any sense? It will most likely be my last internship before graduating as well.  


The job description itself was pretty Data Science heavy but the role is **Data Analyst** which could mean the actual tasks could differ.  I'm debating because my previous Data Science Intern roles were at small companies and not really recognizable at all (one being government related). This new Data Analyst Intern role is at large company that everyone knows so at least I'd have something with a bit of a ""reputation"" on the resume.  


Is having a big company thats reputable on your resume beneficial for future DS career goals even though it's a Data Analytics Intern position? Will it help getting that foot in the door to get interviews because of the name recognition of the company? Or is having a DA Intern role limiting and restricting your future potential?

"Hi r/datascience. I was looking for a bit of advice from the community here. 

I'm currently working as a scientist in the chemical industry. My main responsibility is building models to quantify chemical species or classify chemical materials from the data output from my company's instrument. The data has a large k (3000 columns) and can have small (15) to large-ish n (60000 samples). 

The data analysis is called chemometrics, and I've seen the field described as a subset of data science. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemometrics

I'd like to figure out if and how I could better advertise my transferrable skillset to a wider pool of positions and industries. I understand that I am far from a data scientist, but my base knowledge may be a good start. I've described my skills/job below, and I hope that someone could comment on whether I have potential to grow into data science, how I would advertise my skills, and what would be good to learn next. 

I ensure the data collected is good, and it is usually sourced from specialized data files. I have some experience pulling this data out of SQL databases. I then preprocess the data as necessary (cleaning, munging, feature selection), and then build models on the data. This usually involves derivatives applied across the data, normalizations (SNV), and smoothing. There are other mathematical transformations applied as well, especially in baseline corrections. 

For building the model, usually I use partial least squares regression for quantification, but I've also used support vector machines to quantify as well. For classification I've used knn, logistic regression, SVMs, and other methods as well. I commonly use PCA for dimensionality reduction before the classification methods listed. To optimize the method parameters, I usually use a cross validated RMSE or a confusion matrix. Validation of the model occurs with separate prediction sets.

To do the math, I've used python, R, and Matlab. I also have extensive experience with industrial software packages such as SIMCA. 

How would I go about rebranding myself into data science? I understand I'm not there yet, but I hope that my potential is there. Any advice would be much appreciated, and thank you very much for taking the time to read my rambling post.

Anyways, I am working on a project to take time series IOT sensor data to predict maintenance issues at a facility. I have a backlog of the time series sensor data as well as a log of maintenance calls from the same period of time that the sensor data covers. The goal is to take the sensor data and work order data and find correlations that can predict maintenance before failure. I have done a few data mining classification projects in school which are really my only experience in the field. My biggest hold up right now is how to format the data in a way which classification could be done.   


My current thinking is that I will associate a positive label to the sensor data if it occurs within a certain period of time(such as a few days) before a maintenance issue, otherwise it will get a negative label. Then I can run classification algorithms on the data to determine if the sensor data is predicting equipment failure. I feel like my thinking here is almost definitely not going to work, but I don't really know any other methods to try to complete this task. Does anyone have any experience in this area, or know of any resources to help with this type of task?

"I know this cliche but this all started in a dream.

Long story short, i had a dream where I thought I saw my mom who died from COVID last year and asked my sister if that was really her. She told me it wasn't really her but some AI designed to match her personality and replicate her mannerisms, so that people could have a conversation with someone who passed. (I feel most of us all have loved ones who aren't with us anymore.)

So I woke up and kept thinking of it. I'm flip flopping if I want to engage in this as a long term project.

There are two big questions floating in my noggin:
1. Do people want this?
2. Is this technology possible?

By the title, I'm focusing this post on question two although feel free to answer the first as well.

So here's my thoughts on what would be required:
1. Learning the mannerisms and personality - I thought this could be done if we had access to Facebook API and recordings of video (home video).
2. Learning the voice - Videos exist where it could learn the voice but i dont know how an output would happen. I know it exists. (Remember the end of Rogue One where it essentially created Leia?)
3. Being able to converse and answer questions - Alexa and Siri exist. My question is, how difficult would this be to create from scratch? Would it be unfeasible without the help of an entire team and millions of dollars?

I'm sure there's a lot I'm missing. I'm sure this is technically possjble someday, but could this be done with our technology today? What else would need to be figured out?",Does AI exist to replicate personalities?,datascience

"I'm not saying there's a right or wrong method here. I am just wondering because I have noticed that some people do step 1 and then go straight to step 3... OR some just start with 3.  


Also I do a lot more data/statistics work than I do modeling sometimes. I feel like people think data science and think ""ML"".

Here's what I do

1. Clean Data ( if it's not already... maybe i need to scale or normalize or I do that between step 2 and 3)
2. Explore Data (Visuals, statistics, correlations)
3. Start with a Base Model depending on what my dependent variable is (this step includes train/test/cv)
4. Think about feature selection, accuracy, and limitations
5. Improve or change the model (this step may include regularization)
6. Repeat some of the steps of the above

I usually get data in the form of hundreds of Excel files, which run into several 10s of Gb's once collated. I use Pandas for data analysis.

"At my job we process Bank Reports that we get as CSV files, currently we have an Excel Template that does all the calculations for us.

The Template works great, all that is needed is to paste in the new values and define the new table Size for the Data and all the calculations are performed.

It has a couple of Pivot Tables and some tabs with calculations based on exchange Rates.

In Total the Template has 14 Tabs all summarizing or processing the entry data in some way.

The problem is we have to process each file in a one-by-one basis, and we would like to Automate this process to allow for it to process between 1k to 5k files monthly, with as little human intervention as possible.

The reason for this post is because I’m in search of recommendations on how to go about this.

My first thought was to simply upload this Template File to my server and have the server handle any CSV files that I sent that way by having python open the template File, filling up the main table with the incoming Data and adjusting the Table size, then sending the resulting file back as a response.

That way I just need to set up an S3 bucket (My boss likes AWS for some reason) where I place my files, and then a lambda function that sends them as POST Request to my server.

But the Python library that I know of that can accomplish this task, pywin32, does not work on a Linux based system and I cannot find any equivalent ones that do.

I could just Recreate the whole process using either pandas, or even SQLAlchemy, but that would take a substantial amount of work and even then, I would still need to deal with formatting and making everything nice to look at.

I then decided to look into some Data Wrangling software, Trifacta for example, but I’m not sure if it will be able to perform the tasks that I require.

Any recommendation on how to approach this task will be appreciated, be it a python library that you think could do it, or a software that you know of or even that you sell, anything that you believe can get this done.

I will soon start a project where I need to create a classification model from tabular data (both numeric and categorical). I would like to avoid the usual mess that occurs when you try multiple models in a rush (and we will be in a rush!) by creating a model archive on the cloud (S3 storage) where every model that performs decently gets saved together with its performance metrics and preprocessing/feature engineering details. While the model choice is relatively straightforward (constraints are no deep learning, no ensemble modelling) a lot of effort will be on the feature engineering part ( the data is highly imbalanced and with a 200+ features that will need to be selected, and engineered heavily). Also we expect much more data to come in the future, so 100% we will need to retrain the whole thing in a few months.

**It occurred to me that while saving the trained model is straightforward, I do not really know how to save the preprocessing pipelines details!**

I was wondering if you have any idea /tool /best practice to ensure reproducible feature engineering and safe storage of preprocessing steps. The current options I am thinking are:

\-  Save every time the table of the preprocessed data together with the model (feasible but probably memory / cost intensive since the archive is all on AWS)

\-  Setup a system where preprocessing is defined in a config file that gets saved in the model archive (currently seems the best option, but it is not very easy to setup without specific tools)

"Me - I've been a Senior Data Analyst for a couple of years now with a statistics undergrad &amp; a ton of domain knowledge. I'm pretty well-versed in writing performant SQL &amp; building vast dashboards in Tableau, PowerBI. I'm okay with Python and use it sometimes for EDA &amp; for data cleaning. Mostly Python is where I go to try my hand at clustering/predictive ML in a local Jupyter notebook.

For the past 10-11 months or so I've been trying to make my way into a Data Scientist role on the same team I'm on, but I may be going about it the wrong way.

"So there's a strange and ancient kind of government out there called [sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition), where government officials were chosen by lottery. That's right. Straight out of a hat (or [Kleroterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleroterion)), we choose our politicians. I think sortition is very interesting as it sounds remarkably similar to machine learning principles. 

A modern implementation of sortition works as follows:

1. We randomly choose around 1000 people to construct our Congress to construct our representative sample.
2. The lottery Congress deliberates and acts otherwise like an elected Congress would. 
3. Every year, about 1/3 of the sample is rotated out and 333 new people are randomly selected to fill the positions.
4. The assembly votes using majority rule to enact proposals. 
5. If conservatism, damping, or some ""timestep"" reduction is desired, we can demand that multiple layers of assemblies repeat and validate rulings. 
6. With majority rule + multiple batches, sortition ought to iteratively solve towards a sort of optimal, maximal utilitarian preference of the larger population. That of course is the ultimate objective of this algorithm... to iterate towards maximum utility, or maximum satisfaction, of a jurisdiction. 




There's some cool analogies to consider:

1. Like with many ML algo's, sortition relies on using stochastic mini-batches. 
2. Like with ML algos, connected networks of sortition assemblies can break up the problem of governance. For example one assembly can handle proposal generation, another handles agenda settings, another handles judicial review, etc etc. 

Anyways as a mere interested layman but not a ML practitioner, am I off base? Is there a good relationship between ML and sortition?

I worked five years as a statistician/data scientist using SAS almost exclusively. Also fluent in R through training and side projects. 

For the last year I’ve been managing a business intelligence team, a move I made intentionally to get manager experience. 

I would like to get back into the DS world though, with more of the modeling work. Ultimately, I would like to end up in a DS manager role. 

From what I’ve seen, basically everyone is building in Python these days. Unfortunately I have very little experience with Python.

Here are my options as I see them:
1. Take a junior DS role and earn my Python chops that way. 
2. Find a DS manager role that is willing to overlook lack of Python and let me learn on the job. (This is what I’d prefer, but might be a unicorn).
3. Stay in current role and learn Python on the side. Come back in 6-12 months and find a DS manager role.

I’m looking for someone to help me streamline an Inventory planning/projector calculation process which I created with various data tables and fields being pulled from an SQL server vía ODBC connection. Currently, I’m using crystal reports for some data and running queries through Microsoft excel for the rest.

Every month, I calculate the inventory buying plan for my purchasing department. I export all the data into Excel from Crystal reports or refresh the queries already connected to the file. Then I use a series of excel formulas to begin calculating my numbers. There’s so many formulas across so many tables in my excel work book that it will begin to crash. I am looking for someone to help me automate, streamline, this process and help me make changes as I  find opportunities to improve it. 

I spend way too much time on this when my company is growing and my purchasing team doesn’t have the skill set to cover. Inventory is crucial for my business so I really need some help. I’m self taught with Crystal reports and Excel which means my process is probably extremely sloppy and I’m likely using the wrong applications.

"Hi everyone,  


To start off, I'm not exactly that good at self-learning entire fields of subjects. I taught myself some Python and SAS (SAS was more learned on the job tbh), but never really to the point of doing my own Data Science projects.  


Okay, so I'm a 27-year old recent graduate in Economics (as of last year), and I have just started a (part-time) MSc in Econ, but with a specialization in Data Science and Numerical Methods. Basically, a lot of Econometrics and 2 classes on ML\\Big Data manipulation\\NLP. It would take me 2 years to complete the program.  


I have also just begun a job as an Economist at the government (my previous job was waaaaay off course). The job will involve a lot of (SAS) programming and producing statistics on international trade data as I have been told.  


Naturally, I would love to get a job that is more in line with DS\\ML out of school, so I was wondering if acquiring experience as an economist would be relevant when I will be applying for DS jobs. Right now, I have no experience with ML and like I said, self-learning is not exactly my forte so I figured that taking courses related to the field would provide with a solid springboard towards acquiring all the necessary skills. Plus, I will be able to use the projects done in school for future interviews.  


Am I missing something? Has anyone else done a similar path (from economist to data scientist for example)? Am I wasting my time, and will my experience be relevant for that future ""career switch"".

"Extreme TL;DR version: SQL + Python or R with Python being significantly more popular.

Many people on this sub are trying to break into data science from adjacent fields. This was the case with myself too (didn't study CS or Statistics) so I'll give some advice specifically on a FAQ on this subreddit: what programming language(s) should I learn?

Just to preface a remark that will probably come, when I'm referring to data science I'm specifically talking about jobs that include statistical modelling and/or machine learning. I'm well aware this isn't the case for all DS jobs.

As mentioned in the TL;DR: **SQL, Python and R** will be your best friends. Initially you should strive to have basic knowledge of SQL, you can pick the rest up on the job plus deep knowledge of Python. R's tidyverse is easy to pick up and there's many people that start here and become reluctant to switch over to Python and Pandas hence why I suggest doing the inverse.

Now for the interesting part: **C**/**C++, Scala, Java and Prolog**. I'll start by saying this, you will most likely use none of these during your job as a DS, especially PROLOG, but learning (some of) them did give me tremendous value. I picked all of them up while in uni except for Scala. I want to emphasise that you should only look at these (except maybe C++) after you've gotten a deep understanding of at least Python.

Starting with C/C++, this one gave me the most long term value. Learning about stack/heap and memory management in general, especially without smart pointers, std::vector and other modern C++ constructs make you a lot more prudent when programming in *any* language. This rarely happens but just knowing them at an intermediate level allows you to write in Python/R, profile your code and call a C/C++ function to replace the bottlenecks. In all honestly, I dislike these the most (especially C), I learnt these in a combinatorial optimisation course (similar to data structures and algorithms). 

Scala is the only one in this list I picked up in my spare time. I learnt specifically about functional programming in Scala and why FP matters, stopping just before monads were covered. I wouldn't put Scala on my CV but my rather short time with it added some FP tricks into my toolkit. 

Java is ubiquitous in software environments, you will come into contact with it sooner or later so knowing some of it doesn't hurt. Object oriented code, proper use of data structures and design patterns are handy since they make your code so much more maintainable, structured and readable. All these concepts are transferable to Python too. This maybe a controversial opinion but don't underestimate how software engineery data science can really be depending on your employer.

"In my opinion, CSV text files are great because they are so simple, you don't need any special software to open them and inspect or edit their contents, but the big drawback is that they don't record any information about the data types in the columns. Does anybody know any alternative formats which also record type information? This could be anything from a simply recording whether it is a number or string, to something more detailed.

Edit:

Parquet is great but I would like to find a format which is a human readable text format. While a file format like Parquet will be more suitable than CSV in many/most scenarios, in my opinion there are some scenarios where it is overkill, and you loose some advantages of a human readable format like CSV, e.g. being able to edit in a text editor, and track changes in version control.

Storing type information separately for example in a second CSV file or JSON or at the top of the file is a possible solution. The problem is that there should ideally be a standardised approach for which parsers have been written, so that you don't need to write custom code to parse the file.

"Hey guys. Was hoping for some advice on where to go with a project I’m working on.

The original idea was to determine whether we could detect signals from Twitter on what crops for farmers to grow based off tweets. We planned to create a sentiment classifier and run it on tweets containing keywords of different foods (apple, banana) over time, and then see if there was any correlation in those data with other time series data like food price indices.

I’m finding that it’s very difficult to find a very large set of Twitter data that is unlabelled for sentiment. Sentiment140 has a great dataset, but all the data is pre-labelled with sentiment so there’s nothing to predict.

Any ideas on novel ways I could alter this project that would have interesting NLP applications and also carry the spirit of the original idea (help farmers know what to plant with tweets)?  Are there novel ways I could continue to apply sentiment prediction even in a problem with little unlabeled data to predict?  Really appreciate any creative ideas people have.

"I have hundreds of CSV files that each contain hundreds of megabytes of data. To create a class that inherits from PyTorch's Dataset the \_\_getitem\_\_ method must access a single sample at a time, where the \`i\` parameter of the function indicates the index of the sample. However, to perform lazy loading my class just saves the name of each file instead of saving all the data in memory.

So far so good, but I'm having doubts about how to access a single data in the \`\_\_getitem\_\_\` method, in my searches I found the following strategies:

1. In \`\_\_init\_\_\` save the number of samples that each file has, then in \_\_getitem\_\_ load the file with pandas and access the respective line. It is possible to know which file to access by the id received as a parameter, for example: having 2 files, where each has 100 samples, id 100 would represent the first sample of the second file, id 101 would represent the second sample of the second file and so on against. However, this approach has an obvious problem which is the number of IOs needed.
2. Perform the same process presented in 1, but store files in a cache as long as it fits in memory. This approach seems to be better than the first as it reduces the number of IOs as some files will be in memory. The problem with this approach is how the caching policy will be carried out, I thought of using something like \`dask\` to handle this, but \`iloc\` is quite inefficient according to the [documentation](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/dataframe-indexing.html).

"Hi all. I work in a very big company everyone knows, and just started on a new project. I was brought in to work on a new phase of this project so we're not starting from scratch. The existing team has brought me up to speed. 

What they've implemented is a train wreck (it works but not very elegant). I'm a solidly intermediate programmer and data guy. I don't stand so tall that I'm gonna judge anyone, but I definitely take care to write clean, commented code that others can read and debug if needed. 

I use functions appropriately. I've been doing Python for some years and started doing legit OOP this year. I got the hang of it.

"I'm aware that the Data Science job market is generally broken down into 3 fields related to use application of data (leaving out Data Engineer for the moment):

1. Data Analyst: Primarily focused on providing analyses of end result data, often using dashboards, or perhaps some statistical analysis. Traditional primary skills: Dashboarding, data munging and data analysis.
2. Data Scientist: Primarily focused on creating structure and meaning out of large datasets, often with a focus on using math, perhaps machine learning etc, creating novel predictive models etc. Traditional Primary Skills: Math, data munging, data analysis, machine learning.
3. Machine Learning Engineer: Focused on understanding and implementing machine learning/statistical models into software systems. Traditional Primary Skills: Software Engineering, some math, machine learning.

I went from a career of software engineering (C#, .Net, SQL web development) for 10 years,  did a huge pivot and became a medical practitioner (got a doctorate), pivoted back to data analysis, Power BI, and then into Data Science/Machine Learning exploration. Currently advanced to a relatively high level in Data Analysis/BI (head up a team of analysts, was COO as a smaller org) at a large health agency. But I've worked at a startup being the primary ""data scientist"", am familiar with machine learning algorithms from deep learning to decision trees to NLP (my current passion area), where I was integrating that stuff with their main software. Currently most of the ML stuff is do is side/passion project exploration, and while I'm far from creating ML models/frameworks on my own, I am very capable of picking one up from GitHub or existing packages and implementing it against novel often messy data in Python to pull out results and put it into practice either working into other datasets or even creating APIs etc.

So I'm this weird blend of a good amount of subject matter expertise, software development knowledge, BI/Data Analysis (though my stats/math skills I'd only classify as intermediate) and ML familiarity (mostly conceptual/application).

I feel like the best application of my skills is around application, taking data with underlying meaning, applying subject matter expertise and potentially leveraging ML models (NLP in particular) and putting that all together to present novel meaning in user understandable language.

But I feel like I get rejected for Data Scientist roles out of hand for lack of math background, for ML engineer roles for not having enough recent software/ML dev experience in particular on large software projects, and even from some Data Analysis jobs for not having enough of a robust math background (I was rejected at the last round of an interview by a senior DS for not being able to sufficiently describe a ""complex analysis"" I'd done and at another one for doing a take home project where they intended for linear optimization to be used, and I build a fully functional python program using heuristics within the 3 hours timeframe, including generating sample data). But I also feel like I don't just fall into the 60-80k a year drag and drop dashboard maker category.

Maybe it's just the artifact of being older (with now 20+ years work experience) but I feel like I don't fit cleanly into any of the cookie cutter data roles. Anyone have any thoughts on how to position myself and/or where I should focus? I have a hard time taking nitty gritty core math classes as I'm a very results/practical outcomes focused person so glaze over if I can't quickly see the applications (and honestly don't see many in the roles I've been in), though I've tried!

"Hi there

What do you guys think about using a ML  model to find statistical differences between populations? Let me explain my particular case:

I have a dataset of 56 cells (more to come) coming from 4 different patients (target variable) with different illness conditions, each cell has \~22 numerical features and our aim is to find differences among the patients (one being the control). Since looking for correlations between features and statistical differences become too overwhelming and tedious, I thought of training a interpretable ML model and use it to discover which properties have the cell of each patient, There is no intention/value to make future predictions. The 2 best performing models were Logistic Regresion and a Random Forest with AOC &gt; 0.9 and F1-score &gt; 0.9 (trained with the whole dataset an 10-fold CV). Afterwards I use the SHAP-values and permutation feature importance to see which features and values intervals are more characteristic for each patient. Although there is a bit of discrepancy between the order of the most important features given by LogReg and RForest, there is good agreement for the most important features at each case. I found this method superior to PCA since some features add little to the global variance but are important for a particular patient.

This is exploratory research, so the main question to answer with this approach is: is the good performing model a good way of finding whether cells coming from different illnesses are different?

"**TL;DR**: I am looking for datasets of which the attributes can be intuitively visualized (e.g. as a matrix. an image, a diagram, etc.) and are easy to individually select (e.g. by dragging over the matrix/image). What's more, it should be a dataset with which t-SNE has some difficulty, and of which some conceptual clusters are erroneously merged or separated in the embedding.

I am developing an adaptation of t-SNE — specifically [Linear complexity t-SNE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10817) — that allows users to manipulate embeddings on-the-fly, which hopefully results in more intuitive embeddings. To this end, the two main tools are the dragging and fixing of datapoints, and the altering/shaping of clusters by changing the high-dimensional similarities. As an example of the latter, imagine one apparent cluster in a t-SNE embedding of which the user suspects or knows it to consist of two or more ""actual""/conceptual clusters. t-SNE likely hasn't been able to separate them due to the discriminatory attributes (i.e. the high dimensions on which those conceptual clusters differ the most) being a minority within the dataset's high dimensions. In such a case, the user should be able to select all datapoints in this erroneously merged cluster in the embedding, select the discriminatory attributes in a visualization summarizing the selected datapoints, and let t-SNE adapt the similarities in such a way that:

\- inter-similarities (between datapoints from different conceptual clusters) are reduced by a lot

\- intra-similatities (between datapoints from the same conceptual cluster) are reduced very little

Now, I am looking for datasets with which I can demonstrate this feature. Suitable datasets have attributes that can be intuitively visualized and are individually selectable. Grayscale image datasets such as MNIST are an example. [Here is a premature version of my t-SNE adaptation on the MNIST dataset.](https://imgur.com/HWX4tcA)

I select datapoints belonging to digits 4 and 9 (which are always clustered together, even when reseeding), and then I select the attributes that are most discriminatory (i.e. the top portion of the 9) in the attribute visualization. After I let t-SNE adapt the similarities, those two clusters are less ""clingy"" than before. It doesn't work great yet, but it's still a work in progress.

Any suggestions for datasets that exhibit this problem, or directions for where to look, or ideas to go about this, are very much appreciated! :)",Suggestions for datasets that demonstrate my t-SNE adaptation,datascience

"I've been quite demotivated in my job for a couple of months now and I feel like I need a place to vent.  I started a data science career 4 years ago transitioning from an engineering (not software) background. My first job was at a rather large company (2000+ fte) but it is mostly tech company so it was quite a good experience. I grew my knowledge quite fast and was loving it but after 18 months or so I feel like we had reached the ceiling of our impact as a team and we were just kind of doing marginal improvements and trying to find other projects to work on without success. 

I left the job after 2 years and started at a small company (30 fte) as the only and first data scientist with complete greenfield. Although the company is small, it has many users and a lot of data and I saw an opportunity to make large impact quickly. Now a year later, I have build and experimented with just about everything I could think of but the impact has only been marginal. If I was the owner of this company I would say data science is not worth the cost. I'm now at a point where I think companies are very eager to hire people to do ML / Data science without understanding that it's not always generating value for the business.

At the same time, I'm realising I enjoy more all the engineering type tasks that I do over modelling or analysis to a point that I'm considering applying for SE type jobs rather than continuing in DS.

"Hi there,

I've been working with Data Science/Machine Learning/Linear Programming etc for almost 5 years now. Basically the ""too mathematical for software developers/data engineers, too much code for maths/science folks"" category- you know the gist.

What I have noticed is that Data Science either gets treated as a traditional software development team or a BI team. Both of which I think are quite bad. Of course there's a surge of MLOps which is ""standardising"" shipping and maintaining ML in production, but it doesn't focus too much on actually developing the models. 

**Software Development treatment:** Here you lose a lot of flexibility in experimentation, research, model exploration and frankly the failure rate in Data Science projects is relatively high compared to other fields in tech (some things just can't be solved with ML/maths, or simply it is not worth it). Normal software development timelines don't make sense in most cases especially since you rely a lot on backend/data engineers/frontend/product before you even start a project.

**BI treatment:** Well you have 500 scripts, notebooks, analysis spread all around you. There's very little code reviews, basic software development procedures, it's basically the wild west 🤠. The infrastructure  gets built by people who have very little clue (or time) about any of this. Retraining, deployment are a nightmare. Whatever benefit you get in actually have in building the models, you surely loose all of it as soon as your work gets into production. 

How do your teams function and structure the work around this? Do you feel this is a bit chaotic or am I the only one? What tools are you using? I know this is a very broad topic but just wondering.

I started working on this dataset that has these features :

\- ball\_velocity (x,y,z) (3 features)

The velocity can be negative. 

I am feeling confident in normalizing, using the common minmax normalization, the coordinates.   
But when it comes to the velocity, I have no physics background and I do not know if that would hurt the future results. 

I do not believe that it will cause any issues, as we are only re scaling the distribution between 0 and 1. But I just wanted to know your guidelines on normalization. When should I worry about if I should do it or not, when can I do it with my eyes closed.

Long story short my experience with programming is not great, I’m an ai and data science post grad student all the projects that I did were basically me using python and applying statistical methods and trying out new things in python.

"Hello,

if got a data science problem and i am not quite sure how to solve it. I have a dataset about bus arrival times with the Target variable (isDelayed True/False). The dataset has a lot of features that could potentially predict a delay. Such as Weatherdata, Bustype, Weekday or Buffertimes and so on. The assumption is that often not through one variable a delay can be predicted but through complex interactions of multiple variables. To avoid delays in the future, it is critical to not only predict delays but to detect the different cases where delays might occur. So, it is critical to understand the difference of the variable combinations that lead to delay und such that don't. Also it is assumed that there can be multiple different scenarios that can lead to a delay. And so different classes within the delays should be distinguished. Do you have any suggestions how to solve this problem?

My Proposel to solve such a Problem goes as follows:

1. Use a feature selection method to derive important attributes from the dataset

2. Use a simple (or white box) supervised prediction method to find rules about when a bus delays and when not

3. Use a clustering algorithm to explain different scenarios of delays

My Question are:

\- Is this a valid methodologie for such a problem?

\- Is the second step a valid approach to find generalizable rules about the distinction between the two classes with high dimensional data, that sufficiently pictures interactions of variables and are explainable?

\- What could be a good algorithm for step two?

\- Is there a better way to solve this problem?

I hope I provided all Information needed. Thank you very much in advance.

Please refer to my username... Could someone please advise me on the best way forward.
In case it is important, the project outlined is not for work, it is for my own education.

**Problem**:
I want to take a set of structured data including prompts (company name, topic, and a few keywords) and generate an introduction paragraph for the company.  

I am interested in trying some of the open source large language models for this but I am unsure what is the most appropriate model or methods for this.  
  
**Question 1a)**: What is the most appropriate open source model (and sub-variant) for content generation as outlined above? I have seen BLOOM, GPT-NEO, and OPT but unsure which is best for my needs.  

**Question 1b)**: Given the answer to 1a) above, what is the most appropriate way of obtaining decent result to my task? Training a smaller parameter version of one of the above on some training data? Using few shot learning?  
  
**Question 1c)**: For few shot learning, is there any advantages or disadvantages to providing many prompt examples? Most of the time I have seen people use 1 or 2 prompts, but what if I gave 20? Would it improve the results, or just slow the whole thing down?

I'm also interested as a first step to download one of the smaller models to help me to understand how to use these models better. In the future perhaps using an online API like Huggingface will be better, but for now I will try locally.  
  
**Question 3**: Can anyone give me an idea of how much RAM some of the smaller LLM require? 8GB? 16GB? 1000GB?  
Are they able to run in a reasonable time on just a CPU? Just a single GPU?

"Basically the title

I am working on an image dataset with images from 17 classes... And I find myself doing mostly guess work of how many dense and convoluted layers should be there and results are not very intuitive. 

Like one of the answer that I read was keep increasing the dense layers till accuracy stops increasing but instead of increasing, my accuracy decreases with more perceptrons i add in a layer. It also decreases if I increase the number of hidden layers.

For less hidden layers, my model learns with abysmal accuracy I.e. starting from 0.09 (not kidding, also super embarrassing) it reaches around 0.55 at around 5th or 6th epoch and from then it increases at a pace of 0.02-0.03 increase per epoch (which is bogus as the accuracy on my validation data actually decreases after this point)

As for the data, it is highly uneven. With some classes having around 400-600 images while others have around 20000-30000. For training data, I am using 1000 images per each class (directly 1000 for classes that have them and augmenting through randomflips for those classes that have less).

I've been pretty excited reading about all the advancements in LLMs over the years but never took the time to dip my toes in. I'm also a PC gamer and waited until the gpu market dipped a bit to finally buy a RTX3080 and figured might as well get into some hobbyist ML/deep learning experimentation with a new GPU with so many CUDA cores. 

I'm aware its still nothing in comparison to an A100 or the like and that I might still be fairly limited working with any LLM, but wondering if anyone has any experience, tips or guidance on what's possible without a multi-gpu at-home setup, like what's the biggest model one could play with on a single 3080, what to expect in terms of process time per token, the biggest feasible model one could or should use to fine tune on a closed domain dataset, etc. 

If I'm being completely unrealistic in even attempting to fine-tune an LLM locally, please also feel free to clear me of any dilusions. 

Regardless, it's still so fascinating to see all the developments in the space happening so quickly. This is a super exciting time we're living in, and hopefully these kinds of technologies will be more accessible to hobbyists as they're developed to require less compute and consume less energy.

"*(I apologize in advance if this is the wrong forum for my question. I'm not entirely sure where to direct it.)*

**Background:**  
I'm a business professor in Boston, and I expect to be awarded tenure this spring. I also expect my teaching and service demands to reduce quite a bit in the next year. I would like to use this sudden flexibility to begin developing my technical and data skills, which are severely lacking. I am fine with a long-term pursuit (2+ years). I teach undergraduate analytics, but in a very applied and simple way (e.g., Google Analytics, SPSS, linear regression, binary logistic regression, cluster analysis, etc.).

**What I'm looking for:**  
My priorities in developing a side hustle are as such (in this order):

1. Gain career flexibility. My PhD currently limits me to academia.
2. Gain some opportunities for freelance consulting.
3. Improve my capacity to build interesting datasets that could help my research and my students.
4. Develop a more visible skillset that I can publicly showcase (this is understandably vague). Long-term ambitions are to build more of an online presence oriented around an in-demand skillset.

**Ideas:**  
Some areas that I am brainstorming:

1. Machine Learning (Not sure what this industry looks like, so may be a naiive idea)
2. Data engineering (could help me build unique datasets, but would not have access to servers)
3. Web development
4. Data visualization
5. Data science (I understand that some of the topics above fall under this category)

All of these topics have equal intuitive appeal to me. My problem is that I do not fully understand the dynamics of these industries, as I've been tucked away in my academic bubble plugging away at my personal research projects. I am looking to break out of this bubble a bit, while also holding onto the security it provides (not looking to leave academia anytime soon).

-Introduction to Data Science

-Practical Techniques for Data Science

-Data Science Project Portfolio

-Statistical Data Analysis

-Machine Learning and Artificial

-Professional Skills for Data Science

If I chose to stay in integrated undergraduate Masters (4 year course) then I can choose these extra data science modules on my fourth year:

-Practical Machine Learning

-Introduction to Computer Vision

-Computer Graphics

-Risk and Decision-Making for Data Science and AI

-Machine Learning for Visual Data Analysis

-Time Series

-Applied Statistics

&amp;#x200B;

Below are some tips:

&amp;#x200B;

 ### How to adopt a business mindset

\- **Understand how the business makes money.** For you to add value to the business it is crucial to understand their revenue streams and how they make money. 

\- **Relate your work to a business KPI.** To measure the impact of your work, it can be very helpful to relate this to a business KPI. Not always possible, but if you can do it will help in understanding how you can generate value.

\- **Ask for feedback from your manager.** This is very underutilized. Asking for feedback makes you vulnerable, but it will help in understanding what your manager thinks is important. Plus, it shows that you are willing to learn (which is very important in business).

&amp;#x200B;

### How to manage time

\- **Prioritize tasks before analysis.** Before touching data, making a list of all actions you need to do will give more clarity in the process and help in planning your time better. Data science comes with a lot of uncertainty, which will take some of them away. 

\- **Use a data analytics project template.** A document where you describe your hypotheses, data needed, and stakeholders will make you way more efficient. 

\- **Plan update meetings with stakeholders to create soft deadlines for yourself.** This helps you to work towards a date and get work done. 

&amp;#x200B;

### How to communicate insights

\- **Learn good data visualization practices.** Understand how you structure a Powerpoint deck and how you present recommendations. I advise to google for Mckinsey's Powerpoint breakdown. 

\- **Create a dialogue where questions can be asked.** The one you are communicating with will definitely have questions. Allow room in your communication for insights and ask ""was this clear?"" after complicated parts.

\- **Show you are trying to help, not to criticize.** Do not position yourself as the person that knows everything and that the other party is wrong. Be helpful and try to understand where they are coming from.

&amp;#x200B;

### How to collaborate with others

\- **Write code together.** Writing code together helps to stay sharp and spot errors. This will lead to better work.

\- **Use Kanban boards to assign tasks and track progress.** Use Kanban boards to decompose big assignments into smaller tasks. Keep the board updated to track progress.

\- **Have multiple update calls per week.** This depends on the project, but having update calls with your peers \~2 times per week to discuss challenges helps to spend less time on parts where you are stuck.

"OK, I know this question will make a lot of you mad. I can see the replies now: Data science means different things at different companies, different algos are used for different contexts, Python vs R, senior vs junior roles, you're focusing on technologies and implementation while neglecting business context, etc. Yeah, I get it. My goal with this post is, with your help, to build a list of technologies/platform/skills from the broad array of what's considered data science and should be known by a DS with about 3 years of experience, in the opinion of the poster (that's you). Nothing is too broad or specific. For example, Naive Bayes, GNNs, containerization, and Docker are all valid answers (yes, I realize Docker is an implementation of containerization, and that's my point..) Please, if you would be so kind, include why you think it's important and to what depth/capability a DS with 3 years of experience should have with it. Since I'm a python person, let's exclude R from the conversation.

Why am I asking this? In full candor, I feel like I am seriously stagnating. I am really the only DS in my company, so it's very easy to lose sight of where the field is currently because so much of my job is simple excel/pandas stuff. I would potentially like to start interviewing, but I feel like I am far behind where a typical DS with my YOE would be. Like, for example, I have no clue how to use airflow or any non-AWS scheduler, every time I do anything related to ML (a very rare occurrence, unfortunately), I have completely forgotten the sklearn syntax, I know pretty much nothing about actually training an NN, I know in theory what a basic NN is, but I have no idea about graph NNs or graph databases or graph anything. I still have no clue what distinguishes a data warehouse from a database after reading countless articles. I feel like I don't even know what I don't know; for anything I do know, it's hard to tell if what I'm doing is the best practice.

"Let's say I have a sequence of terms. Each term could be any string of alphabetical characters. `['abc', 'stg', 'drT']`. Now let's say I have millions of such sequences of varying length (might be 1 term, might be 1000) and some of them are 'bad'. But their combination matters toward that badness. So I'm baselining and looking for outliers, which should have a high correlation with 'bad' in my dataset. Term might indicate 'badness' in one combination but is totally benign in another.

So that's our search-space and problem statement. I am not educated in DS. But I understand the basic idea: Correlate traits and relationships of features in one or more data-sets to answer a question / solve a problem. But which features to select? It seems like an interesting question, since as analysts we don't know everything and if we try to select feature manually, there's a good chance we might miss something. Right? There might be some combination of features which, when correlated with some combination of other features ends up being a good indicator that we wouldn't have manually expected. Maybe 3 features plotted on a 3D chart with K-Means clustering or just human viewing reveals something interesting / creates a valuable signal that we might not have guessed or tested if we were hand-picking the features we thought might be useful.

So I'm computing an exhaustive list of features globally and locally, like:

How standard / deviant is the feature locally?

* local occurence count
* local occurence as % of total local feature count

How standard / deviant is the feature globally?

* global occurence count
* global occurence count as % of global feature count

How is the feature related to other features locally?

* for each term: for each other term: min distance, where distance is in terms of index
* for each term: for each other term: max distance, where distance is in terms of index
* for each term: for each other term: avg distance, where distance is in terms of index
* for each term: for each other term: min distance, where distance is in terms of character count
* for each term: for each other term: max distance, where distance is in terms of character count
* for each term: for each other term: avg distance, where distance is in terms of character count

How globally standard / deviant is the feature's relationships to other features locally?

* for each term: for each other term: min distance as % of all global min distances between these two symbols, where distance is in terms of index
* for each term: for each other term: max distance as % of all global max distances between these two symbols, where distance is in terms of index
* for each term: for each other term: avg distance as % of all global avg distances between these two symbols, where distance is in terms of index
* for each term: for each other term: min distance as % of all global min distances between these two symbols, where distance is in terms of character count
* for each term: for each other term: max distance as % of all global max distances between these two symbols, where distance is in terms of character count
* for each term: for each other term: avg distance as % of all global avg distances between these two symbols, where distance is in terms of character count

That's the theory I'm experimenting with, planning to just produce every possible chart, perhaps thousands, and then do some simple clustering on all of them and see if features associated with known-bad sample have a statistical tendency to end up in distinct clusters in any of those plots.

Am I potentially on the right track? Is this a known strategy in data science?

From your experiences is it doable to “make it happen”? I’m really conscious that I’ll have to sharp my skills for both of them, so I’ll also enroll in trainings or and take some homework to do.

Does anyone know about image sequencing? I have this project that I have to do.

Okay, I will explain the dataset and what I have to do. Please do lmk if you guys have any references I can check.

So the dataset consists of images with their sequence id. For example:- let us say there are 3 images.

1. The first one is where a person walks to his table. Which will be the first order of the sequence.
2. The second order is the person getting a glass of water.
3. The third is him drinking the water from the glass.

Like this, there will be lots of images. 6 in one sequence so each sequence will have 1-6.

So what I have to do is train a model with the first 3 images of the sequence and then the model will have to predict the other three images and the output will be the order of the image. Example - \[1,2,3\]

"In my current role (F500 but not BigN), I am a data scientist but most of my day i feel more like a backend engineer.

It took another 3 months to wrap it as a microservice not only for the product, but for other products to use if they would like to. It took a while to run the backend, understand their microservice framework, and this is my first time creating one.

I understand being a good backend engineer can't hurt, and if I wanted to, it provides skills if I ever want to pivot to SWE. But I feel like there's a LOT more to learn within the data science field already but now I have to add SWE to that list as well?  

On the one hand, I understand that DS isn't just building models, cleaning data. It's using data to help the business, regardless of the tools you use. So if microservices and proper deployment gain visibility and actually 'productionize' your model, then it's just something you do.

"I'm trying to generate a gibberish language to use for character dialogue in a game, similar to the 'Animalese' of Animal Crossing. 


At the moment, I am hashing the English input sentences, truncating the hash to match the input sentence length, and then mapping each hex character of the hash to an arbitrary syllable (which is associated with an audio clip). While this works well enough, I am hoping to add some realism using universal sentence embeddings, so that similar sentence meanings map to similar gibberish forms and it hopefully seems more like a real language. I need the following features:

1. Sentences with similar meanings should have a similar gibberish output. For example, if the sentence 'hi there' maps to 'grebgol', the sentence 'hello!' should be likely to translate to 'grebgol' as well, or a string similar to it. 

2. A gibberish sentence should have approximately the same number of syllables as the input English sentence. e.g. ""Look!"" might generate ""Shleg!"" but ""This path is dangerous"" might generate ""Vnepsweg zeb sirugkijun"". 


So far, my code is generating a sentence embedding for each input sentence using Tensorflow Universal Sentence Encoder. But I am not sure how to go about generating a gibberish string from the embedding. I suppose I need some kind of dimensionality reduction like PCA analysis to obtain a set of one dimensional vectors from my list of input sentences. Then I can map the contents of each vector arbitrarily to my syllable recordings. But then my gibberish sentences will all be the same length - this is where I'm stuck.",Generating gibberish game dialogue from universal sentence encodings,datascience

* I lead a group of PhD students to implement (and improve on) image segmentation algorithms
* I'm published
* I have a graduate certificate in neuroscience
* I have two bachelor degrees in philosophy and English respectively (although I've completed math up to and including differential equations)

We call it freeism.  


About freeism

We came up with the ""freeism"" system as an alternative economic mechanism to capitalism.

It gives a new alternative to economic mechanisms that have had only limited choices, such as capitalism and socialism.

I know that many people are already thinking about this kind of thing, but I would like to implement it as a part of the social structure, not as a theoretical theory, and eventually create a society in which the entire economy revolves around freeism instead of capitalism.

The following is an explanation of the basic mechanism of FREELISM.

The supplier is asked to provide all types of goods and services for free, and non-transferable points (SBT?) (called contribution points) are given to those who provide them.

There will be multiple ways to calculate contribution points, and we will also create a mechanism to provide them.

The mechanism is described below.

For products or services that are not available to all who want them (hereinafter referred to as ""limited edition products""), the points (hereinafter referred to as ""quota"") will be set as the square root of contribution points, and those who offer to use the most quota will be given priority in using them.

Instead of consuming contribution points as compensation for obtaining goods or services, they should only be accounted for so that they cannot be used to obtain other limited items.

Therefore, contribution points do not decrease even if a limited item is obtained but accumulate (exceptions apply. See below)

Necessity

The necessity of the quota is described below.

The method of calculating the quota is also described below.

This type of economic mechanism is called ""freeism.

Freeism is an economic model that can be finally established by using technologies such as data analysis, blockchain, web apps, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Dig a little deeper into the mechanism of FREESISM

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This section explains each of the mechanisms that make up FREESISM.

&amp;#x200B;

Contribution rules

The rules of contribution are the laws that govern life in a freeism society.

Or the country in which the law is located.

At first, only one rule exists, but just as there are multiple countries, multiple rules of contribution can be created.

The contribution rules should be easy for anyone to create.

I want the rules of contribution to be divided by ideology and taste (only some people emigrate based on taxation, culture, and taste, but for the most part, the current country is determined by birth and upbringing, and there are people with different tastes, values, and ideology in the same country, which creates conflict).

That is why we create the right of non-interference as the right not to interfere with others.

Each contribution rule has an end goal.

The end goal is discussed below.

&amp;#x200B;

The FREEISM Platform

The freeism platform is a mechanism to manage the rules of contribution.

The rules of contribution play a legal role.

The freeism platform becomes a higher-level entity like the Constitution OR the UN OR the federal government.

The freeism platform also has rules, and within the scope of those rules, they get to make the rules of contribution.

There will be multiple freeism platforms, and people will be able to join any freeism platform they want.

A freeism platform may also have an end goal.

The end goal is described below.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Final Goal

The end goal is the goal that each freeism platform, each contribution rule, and each project (like a company) is aiming for.

It can be set by vote, decided at the establishment stage, or left to the decision-makers to set.

Set goals that you want to achieve, not goals or KPIs to achieve subdivided goals.

For example, ""increase in happiness,"" ""degree of health,"" ""increase in productivity,"" ""increase in the number of rational decisions made,"" and ""crime rate.""

It is unclear if we would set ""lower crime rate"" as a goal since even ""lower crime rate"" might be a goal to achieve higher levels of happiness. We want to set a goal that we are ultimately aiming for.

For FREEISM, we should set a final goal for the FREEISM platform, a final goal for the contribution rule, and a final goal for the project, and then calculate the contributions based on how much they have helped to bring us closer to or achieve that final goal.

Examples of final goals

Increase in productivity (working hours required to obtain goods and services) within the limits of the law

Increase in happiness within the limits of the law

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Contribution points

Refers to points required to obtain priority for limited items.

Contribution points are non-transferable.

However, loans are possible under some contribution rules.

Can I use SBT as contribution points?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How to Calculate Contribution Points

Contribution points earned are calculated based on ""the degree of contribution to the final goal"" ✖︎ ""market principle"" ✖︎ ""different weighting/rules for each contribution rule.""

Until now, it was ""market principles"" ✖︎ ""different weighting/rules for each country or region rule"", but we will add ""degree of contribution to the final goal"" to it.

I think the market principle is encapsulated in the degree of contribution to the final goal. However, if you still want to make further use of the market principle, you can give contribution points based on ""market principle x degree of contribution to the final goal"" or ""market principle only"".

The degree of contribution to the final goal could be calculated using multiple regression analysis or other data analysis methods or methods to visualize DAO's task-based contribution.

See below.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Quota

The quota is a mechanism to avoid monopolizing the service, and if the service can be provided to everyone, the quota is not used.

Each contribution rule has a different way of calculating the quota, and each person is given a quota weighted by contribution points (contribution points ✖️0.9 = amount of quota, etc.) or the square root of contribution points.

The amount of quota used will be the price.

There is a negative correlation: the lower the winning rate of a product or service, the more quota it occupies, and the closer the winning rate is to 100%, the less quota it occupies.

In FREESISM, the quota is always used while the limited item is in use, and the amount used always reflects the market value, not the amount used when it was acquired.

The structure of the quota differs for each contribution rule.

The period you occupy a quota should be the period you own that limited edition item.

If you give it away or throw it away, you can apply for it on the FREEMISM platform, or the service will automatically detect it and release the use of the quota.

To prevent ""false applications"" where people apply to give it away when they own it, make it necessary to give it away or throw it away at a predetermined location or app.

Create an incentive to have it detected through the app, since it should be detected from each app and if not through the app, it will occupy the frame all the time.

Make it impossible for people to report that they have given it up on their own, other than by having the app automatically detect it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

FREEISM

In freeism, if other people refer to the products, services, source code, or other deliverables developed by each person, or to know-how and other things such as research findings, they will receive only a portion of the contribution points earned by the person they refer to, such as 0.5 times the contribution points earned by the person they refer to.

Thereby.

If someone only submits an idea and others implement it, the person who submitted the idea will also receive a portion of the contribution points earned by the person who implemented it.

If another company started a business and failed but was successful in running it by avoiding the strategies of the failed company, then allow the people who worked in the failed company to receive a portion of the contribution points earned by the successful company.

That way, where it was 0-1 to succeed or fail, maybe we could make it so that even if it fails, it is not 0-1 financially, but there is some benefit.

Since points are just points, unlike the currency, they don't have to be distributed and can be offered to both.

But it's hard to determine if that's what I was referring to.

I will discuss this later.

We want a society where everything is open source.

I want to create a society where every no-how, patent, and other thing is open source, by weighting the contribution points that can be earned if others use the no-how, and by weighting the contribution points that can be earned just by making it open source, such as 1.2 times the contribution points that can be earned by making it open source.

Everyone gets it without having to distribute, and being open source could lead to more compensation for sharing without monopolizing rather than monopolizing and competing.

But if the relative position without distribution determines whether you get a limited product, is it the same as when profits were shared?

It's more mentally stable because you don't have to fight for a piece of the pie.

The basic idea is to think in terms of rules of contribution, where the only rule is the degree of contribution to the liberal end goal, but when considering various rules of contribution, we can make a law that regulates each of them in a way that is characteristic to the sound of each rule of contribution.

Even if any action is the wrong action or not, we will stipulate that only actions that have a bad impact on the final goal contribution level are bad.

Even theft would not be a crime if it did not negatively impact anyone.

Somewhere the idea is like a woman who says it's not cheating if she doesn't get caught in a love story about whether or not she qualifies as cheating.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The position of each

In freeism, the system is divided into a freeism platform, contribution rules, projects, and other mechanisms.

The freeism platform is the role of the federal government, the contribution rule is the role of the state government, and the project is the role of the company.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Project

The role of the company.

The idea of freeism is to make everything open, so all the data of companies that are currently hidden will be shared and made available to everyone so that the contribution points earned will be weighted 1.1 times more than before.

Or, by being more open, make the service more technical and reliable, so that it is seen as contributing to the well-being and other end goals.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Price

The lower the winning rate (the percentage of people who apply who win), the more quota is occupied and the more the beneficiary pays.

The amount of quota used becomes the price, so if the winning rate increases, the price becomes ""completely free"" with zero quota use of zero yen.

In capitalism, even for products with high demand and high supply, the price is close to the cost, but the beneficiaries bear the burden.

In FREEMISM, the overall goods and services are cheaper because they are negatively correlated with the winning rate, regardless of cost.

Furthermore, since the added value cannot be added to the price, the price becomes cheaper by that amount, and the beneficiary burden of freeism is better than the beneficiary burden of capitalism.

The provider of goods and services receives nothing from the beneficiary for providing goods and services, and the beneficiary pays nothing to the provider for acquiring goods and services, which only increases the amount that occupies the quota managed by the freeism platform.

The provider can offer goods and services to those who cannot afford to pay for them, and if they do, the business will be compensated.

  
Life of FREEISM

Let's imagine and write about what society would be like in a society where FREESISM is realized.

&amp;#x200B;

Download or use any of the web apps, native apps, VR or AR apps of the freeism app (which also serves as the freeism platform) that manages all the functions of freeism, from a web app, native app, VR, or AR app, or a browser.

In the freeism app, choose the contribution rule to which you want to belong.

Enter various information about yourself and link it to the contribution rule you have chosen, and generate an account with the data for that contribution rule.

You can put the date of the contribution rule you belong to as a property in your wallet for Web3, or in your Google account for Web2, etc.

With the account containing that data, data is acquired from various applications and the contribution rules are calculated using that data.

Furthermore, according to each contribution rule, you can display 00 content on Twitter, but not 00. If the content is prohibited by each rule of each contribution level, such as ""00 content is allowed to be displayed on Twitter, but 00 is prohibited,"" each rule of each contribution level will be detected from the account and automatically hidden.

When you want to get a product or service on each platform of freeism services or existing services (Amazon, Spotify, etc.), you can get the person's contribution points from the API that can get the contribution points of each person managed by that freeism platform, and Then, we can set up an input field in the platform, such as Amazon, where people can input how many quotas they want to offer, and those who offer the highest amount will be given priority to receive?

Is it faster to create a new one?

Those who offer limited items in the above process will receive contribution points for the contribution rules to which they belong.

There is no such thing as an exchange rate between multiple contribution points, so the more contribution rules that contribute to the ultimate goal of the freeism platform, the larger the percentage to be offered (tentative idea).

"I understand that you need to do Power analysis in order to figure out what sample size you need for your AB test, but something that I have difficulty coming up with is “what MDE should we use?”  Researching online hasn’t been much help because all I see are examples of where they just give an MDE to use but don’t explain the process of getting there. 

For my company, a lot of our tests have very low operational costs, so in almost all cases any positive performance is worth rolling out. Basically, even if we saw only a 0.05% lift, if it was statistically significant, we’d probably implement the change. This has led me down a path where I basically just check to see what MDE we can reasonably detect given the number of users coming into the platform INSTEAD of determining what MDE is actually valuable. I feel like this is the wrong approach, but I’m unsure what else to do given that our “goal” MDE is basically anything above 0. This especially makes it difficult for me to determine when I should stop the tests as well, other than picking a somewhat arbitrary end point of 3-4 weeks and then seeing if there is any directional value from the data.

"TL;DR: Has industry demand on experts in Bayesian-ML for Control Engineering?

&amp;#x200B;

Hey,

I'm a CS student right before my master thesis and I have to take a decision between two career topics:

1. Becoming an NLP expert.
2. Becoming an expert on Bayesian-ML for Control Engineering.

The path I want to take is Master-Thesis --&gt; PhD --&gt; Industry. There are many pros and cons for me to take any of these two. I'm here because I doubt the demand of the industry on additional experts in *Bayesian-ML for Control Engineering*. The doubts originate from the following reason.

People are working on Bayesian methods since decades and engineering also does respectively. So it might be, that experts from these decades are already spread through the industry.

NLP in comparison is pretty new and on high demand without a doubt.

"Hi,  I am wondering about about some recent trends I have been experienced at work with younger or less experienced data scientists.

People are fitting these large multivariate, nonlinear models that come directly from python libraries, for example PyOD outlier detection.   They just compare results from all the built in ML algos.   They don't think about any simple methods what so ever for detecting outliers.   However, the end user always drills down to univariate to see if the features are significant anyway.     So I don't see the purpose in testing the advanced algos without a baseline.

So instead of starting with a basic statistical outlier method, or univariate or linear method,like PCA, all of this is skipped and considered irrelevant or ""dinosaur"".  

My argument is that if you don't have a baseline simple method, you will never understand the benefit the ML algo brings .    Basically if they cant can't find a benefit over univariate ,  they shouldn't promote the advanced methods yet.

What are your thoughts on this?

How do I convince these people to slow down and take baby steps to see the benefits without insulting them?

So I was told this would be a Data Analyst role. I mainly chose a DA role since it contributes to DA/DS work experience and its easy to combine with studies (I'm doing an MSc in CS after a CS undergrad). Upon joining I figured out they actually meant ""Data Analyst Engineer"", whatever that even means. Tasks range from optimizing bootstrapping scripts, to modifying and deleting DB columns/merging stuff. Writing logic for processing data in Pyspark, etc.

"Hi,

I am sorry to spam another post about career advice. I will divide this post into two sections so it will be easier to read/advise. You can skip background if you are not interested and jump straight to my question.

BACKGROUND: I am currently a data analyst (for about 3 years). I've got into the field by accident (internship at uni) and just stayed, landed my first job in healthcare and about 5 months ago I moved to a cyber security company.

I've learned everything on my own so far. I use Excel, SQL, Power Bi, domo, Salesforce, Workday, Oracle and more in my work. I am relatively good (my managers are happy with my work). At the end of the year I will receive a set of objectives, so I could get a promotion as senior data analyst.

With that being said, Even though I have some experience in workplace, I dont have any educational background (I have a master's in management  which helps in some ways but it is not enough). Since I joined this sub I have read many post/comments and sometimes when I read them, I think you are casting some spells. English is not my first language (I speak it fluently as I live now in the UK) and some vocabulary or definitions are too foreign to me. I believe I could fix it with some education.

&amp;#x200B;

QUESTION: I am data analyst, hopefully at some point senior data analyst, but I am planning to try working as a business analyst and eventually as a data scientist (Im not in rush but that is my goal). I would like to start learning from the basics. I have around 6-8 months of relative peace and extra time. I want to complete statistic/probability course, which hopefully will help me advance in my career.

First I want to learn calculus, statistics and probability. It should help me to become a business analyst. Later in the future, move to python, machine learning etc. and move towards data science. I want to focus first on the former. 

Could I ask you redditors to help me find a course (preferably with some certificate at the end) for an introduction to statistics? I have checked edX. MiT's courses look the best, but enrolment is too far in the future to wait for it. Apart from MIT I found 'Probability and Statistics' (4 courses) from Georgia Tech. I also check coursera and 'Business Statistics and Analysis Specialization' from Rice looks ok-ish. These take different lengths of time to complete, but I am pretty flexible. As said before, I have about 6-8 months and I could spend up to around 10h per week. If you know the course which will take me 3 months but is great, I will gladly take it. There are also some shorter courses on DataCamp but I would prefer something a bit more serious and in depth.

I hope that makes sense. What are your thoughts and advice?

For context, I have been working in a data science position for \~1.5 years now within the same company, and am exiting the junior status. I'm the only one in this company that could call himself a data scientist, so I dont have many people here I can talk about this situation with.

A rough summary of my role : We make POCs and evaluate the value it would deliver in production, and help in implementing into production.  So lately, we have successfully pushed projects based on my POCs to government funding. Those grants can be huge, covering almost 50% of total expenses, with a very high maximum grant ceiling. e.g. :  [https://www.scaleai.ca/](https://www.scaleai.ca/)

Obviously, I'm a bit jealous, because I feel like I don't get a fair share of the pie in this deal. My company wants to develop a certain level of expertise in data science, but are throwing all the grant money at consultants and leaving a lot less for actual employees.

" In theory, could hospital triage be solved using ""regression models"" (e.g. logistic regression, random forest regression)? Suppose you have a historical dataset where you data (covariates) on patients such as ""age, gender, height, weight, blood pressure, etc."" , and the response variable is ""the number of days the patient spent in the hospital"".

1) Just a shot in the dark - it seems that you should be able to make a regression model that predicts ""how long the patient is expected to stay in the hospital""?

2) Suppose the hospital is interested in improving how they triage their patients. In this imaginary example, let's say that the hospital wants to identify patients who will be discharged from the hospital shortly after they come to the hospital (because the logic being, patients who leave the hospital shortly after coming to the hospital, usually have non threatening conditions and do not need to be prioritized). Suppose the hospital makes such a regression model : now for 5 new patients, they predict the discharge times for these patients as (2 days, 5 days, 30 days, 40 days, 10 days).

If the hospital has reasons to believe that the regression model is effective (based on performance)- (along with the prediction intervals for these estimates) would it be reasonable for the hospital not to prioritize the patients who are expected to stay only 2 days and 5 days in the hospital?

3) does anyone have any recommendations for statistical/machine learning models that can be used to help humans with these kinds of triage decisions?

"Hello I need some advice how to best start my project.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been given a dataset where each row equals a produced workpiece in a factory.

&amp;#x200B;

Each row (workpiece) has columns with information about:

\- the parts (batch numbers) it consists of (categorical data)

\- measured values along the production process  (continuous data) 

\- a specific label for if the workpiece got a failure in the production process or is good (boolean)

&amp;#x200B;

An important info:  

&amp;#x200B;

From left to right in a row, the measured values are grouped into production steps. 

&amp;#x200B;

So first I have measured data for step 1 (then gets evaluated if it has a failure)

Then I have measured data for step 2 (then gets evaluated if it has a failure)

Then I have measured data for step 3 .. and so on ..

&amp;#x200B;

This also means that if a workpiece gets a failure along production step 2, there is no further data for step 3 available because it got removed at step 2.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to find out:

\- potential workpieces that might a failure at the current step.

\- potential workpieces that might have a failure at a later step (for example step 4) based on data from previous steps (for example step 1 and 2).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It kind of sounds like a logistic regression problem to me. I can do supervised learning because I have the label wether a workpiece has a failure or is ok.

Also I can split the datasets column wise into parts (depicting the production steps). This will probably result in many ml models for every possible combination of steps and previous steps..

I am doing a credit risk migration exercise between two time periods. I have the data of relevant credit risk parameters and rating for companies in the two periods and I am measuring the impact of credit rating migration between the two periods on for example PD, i.e. How much is the difference of the avg. PD for the different ratings of period 2 with the projected PD from period 1 using Credit migration matrix calculated using the migration in ratings?

I am not sure if I should exclude companies with PD=0 when calculating the actual avg. PD for different credit ratings for the two periods. Intuitively, companies with PD=0 have no outstanding loan and do not add risk or capital requirements. These clients can be used to calculate the credit migration matrix and should be kept for its calculation. However, they bias the Avg. PD for the different rating periods (lead to an underestimation). if you have experience in credit risk,

**MAIN QUESTION:**

DO YOU KNOW IF I SHOULD REMOVE CUSTOMERS WITH PD=0 FROM THE TWO PERIODS WHEN I CALCULATE THE ACTUAL AVG. PD FOR EACH RATING OF THE SECOND PERIOD AND WHEN I PROJECT THE AVG. PD OF THE FIRST PERIOD USING THE CREDIT MIGRATION MATRIX?

**SECONDARY QUESTION:**

"What are the common indexes to use when measuring and reporting model performance in production?

In our case it's a binary classification model (e.g. credit risk). Here are the stages the model goes through:

* Development - here we use GINI / AUC.
* Deployment - the model is exposed through an API
* Production - the model is used to score production records and a decision is taken based on the result whether to approve/deny (this decision is based on some business logic but eventually uses a cutoff point for the model)
* Feedback - after some events has happened in real life, the results are fed back to the system and attached as ""feedback"" to the predicted records. This is true world label result.

At first I thought to measure AUC/GINI of the production data, however I quickly realized that I have only half the picture. AUC is measured from the ROC and in the case of production we only have ""Negatives"" that is - records which have been predicted to be non-eventful. So the best we would have is ""non events we predicted and their results"". To get the ROC we also need events.

What would you measure in such case?

I am considering quitting my job and taking about 2 months off to focus on skillset growth and then another month to focus on interviewing to land a job that better aligns with my career objectives.

\-Programming in Python and R for practice

\-Reading as much textbooks on Python, Machine Learning and even Math(i.e Precalculus, Linear Algebra, refreshing statistics)

"If this isn't the place for this then please direct me to where I may post this.

I have a gaming desktop (Ryzen 3700, 32GB RAM, RTX 2060 SUPER) and a cheapo laptop that I kinda want to replace anyway (5th gen i5, 8GB RAM, Intel integrated graphics).

I want to practice DS and even try learning some GPU programming, so continued access to an nVidia GPU is almost a must.

Now, I have to move soon and I have a remote job, so I'm thinking about doing some traveling and would like to practice stuff on the go. As I see it I have but a few options:

1. Use my/a cheapo laptop to connect via SSH to
   1. my desktop which I would store with family.
   2. an SaaS.
2. Get a newer laptop that is as good as my desktop.
3. Get a newer laptop that isn't quite as good as my desktop but instead comes with Thunderbolt 4 ports and harvest my GPU for an eGPU setup. This maintains the option to use an SaaS for anything that the 11th gen Intel processors can't handle as I would no longer keep my desktop after selling everything but the GPU.

Any tips would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

"Suppose you have ""postal codes"" and you want to use them as a variable in your data. Postal codes are 6 characters long - if two postal codes share the first 5 characters in common, they are probably pretty similar to one another (i.e. located closer to one another). If two postal codes only share the first character, then they are probably pretty dissimilar. And if they share the first 3 characters, then they are expected to be somewhat similar to each other.

My question: suppose you want to use postal codes as a variable in a statistical model, but you are not sure whether to include all 6 characters, or the 5 characters, or the first 4 characters, etc. Each one of these might include some potentially useful information.

If you decide to use a random forest model (which is known to be robust to redundant variables), would it make sense to turn the postal code into 6 separate variables? E.g.

var_1 = 1st character 
var_2 = 1st and 2nd character
var_3 = 1st, 2nd and 3rd character
var_4 = 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th character 
var_5 = 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th character
var_6 = 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th character 

(note, there are other variables in the model as well, e.g. height, age, weight, etc).

This way, the statistical model itself could decide which length of the postal code variable results in the best outcome? Or is this approach bound to result in multicollinearity and overfitting?

"I work at a small firm that exclusively uses Google sheets to manage inventory, sales, etc. They typically use this for filtering/sorting as well as a reference for things like making labels for trucks using a look up on the PO. As you can guess, it's notoriously slow and cumbersome. 

When I was hired last year, they wanted to know what platform to use for Visualizing data and how to speed up the master Google sheet. I suggested Tableau since that's what I learned in school. Fast forward to now and I've created a bunch of vizzes just by pulling the data from the sheet (using R). I've learned that we should be using a data warehouse for a lot of this stuff, so that is what I have been implementing now. 

My issue is: they want to move a bunch of stuff from Google Sheets to Tableau so they can do near instant checking of orders being entered and inventory of products. I've known for some time that Tableau shouldn't be used for everything, but I didn't know that when they first asked me to make all these vizzes. Now I'm stuck because I *know* that Tableau should be used for displaying clean data, but I *don't know* what to offer as an alternative to their ask.

"Are there any Data Science (DS) oriented people working as a Solutions Engineer that can speak to few questions I have?

* How much of your work is hindered by your clients' data quality?
* Has working as an Solutions Engineer made you a more technical or managerial oriented? 
* What are common pain points when communicating to clients the value of DS... is it any different than communicating DS to internal business units?
* What has your general experience been, and would you recommend someone interested in pursuing DS to take a Solutions Engineering role?

I'm currently working as a Data Consultant looking to move into DS role. Working as a consultant gave me a ton of client facing experience. After speaking with a recruiter, it seems like I am in a good position to go for a Solutions Engineering role for an advanced analytics org with proprietary analytics platform. I spoke with *that* org and found the role to be an interesting blend of DS and consulting with a touch of product development (since the role would be interfacing with the customers regularly). 

I am also interviewing with couple of other orgs for a Data Scientist position. If I'm fortunate, I'm anticipating having to decide between Solutions Engineer and Data Scientist roles. I absolutely enjoy coding, analytics, and reading research, so I'd like to move down a more technical path. The current solutions engineer role would be blend of technical + client management, but would the technical experience transfer to more technical DS roles later on?

"Hi all,

I just wanted to make this post to simply share my experience (and also get your perspective/input) using different coding languages, namely python and R, to perform data analysis. I am by no means any expert; just a simple user who is completely in awe with this field.

I have only recently started to code in R (2 months now) and ever since, I cannot help but love it. I only started learn to code since last year and like many, I started off with python because the ML project I was working on last year required me to learn this language.

Since then, I moved to a different lab and the folks there really wanted me to use R to develop the code for data cleaning, performing exploratory data analysis, regression analyses, etc..., since it is the most commonly used language in this field (Enviro. Chem).

While I was initially resistant at first to learn R, once I got the hang of it, it really started to feel like magic to me. What took me maybe 3 to 5 lines of code in python to perform a task (granted, I am not the best coder) is a simple function in R. Somehow, it all just intuitively makes sense to me.

I don't know; I don't find R getting much love out there (at least in my learning experience of data science), and just wanted to make a post about it. I aim to get much better in this language (and also python too), simply because I find this to be a very powerful language.

I guess that concludes my love letter to R.

1. Basic analytics break down into country, age group (or generation), and cluster (like number of invoices, number of client, and revenue)
2. RFM analysis to identify characteristic of top clients. Then again, break down the analytics of those top clients into country, age, and each cluster.
3. Product view, identify which products are often purchased for client base and for top clients. (This can be done by checking word frequency in product description). Then again, break down product view into into country, age, and each cluster.
4. Plot a time series of revenue, number active clients by month to see they respond (multiple line chart series for age, country, and, cluster, so 3 subplots).
5. Predicting their sales next month, and their next purchase days. (This is optional imo)
6. Also, an important step is how to transfer those insights into more making money action?

" Hi everyone!

I wanted to introduce the first North American Students Biotechnology Conference (NASBC)! The conference will be held virtually in July, and will be free to attend and present in.

NASBC aims to provide a forum for undergraduate and graduate students across North America to share biotechnology research. It is a great opportunity to expand your network and showcase your research project to others in your field. If you're not in the field and would just like to learn about it, feel free to RSVP as well! While the presentations will be limited to those in North America, attendance is open to all!

Research will be divided into 8 categories (found on the [website](https://nasbcportal.com/)). One thing I'd like to mention is that there is a category - namely 'Innovation in Biotech', that is specifically for those projects you feel don't really fit into the other categories but combine technology with the health field. I'm pointing this out for those computer science or software engineering students, who have worked on a cool app that would support the health sector.

The abstract submission deadline is coming up soon to remember to send in your abstract ASAP!

Additional information is found on the website ([nasbcportal.com](https://nasbcportal.com/)). The related instagram is [@nasbioc](https://www.instagram.com/nasbioc/).

The two approaches I've thought of is 

1. To do a monthly aggregate of how much product was ordered across all items and do a basic SARIMA with 1s for all values and a time lag of 12 months.
2. To use the prophet library to predict the future, though these results have been poor due to the items having a greater volatility and growth as of late due to covid, product output, and other outside factors.

Avenues I'm considering:

1. Hyperparameter tuning for SARIMA.
2. Using the monthly aggregate of all items to help forecast each individual item, as building SARIMA models for each individual item may not be as useful due to a lack of data, as some items may not be ordered at all some months.
3. Read more of the prophet documentation to try to adjust for the extreme volatility in my data.

My thought is that this would provide an even distribution of our best customers in the control and variant groups.

"I'm a CS student and i've recently been interviewing for several Data Science Internships, one of the companies was a walking red flag. Keep in mind that this wasn't a small startup, this was a huge Company (&gt; 10k employees).

It started when I applied for the position online, they responded after over a month, once I already had several offers. What was interesting was that they were the only company that called me as their first response and did not send a mail, which was a surprise but not a deal breaker to me. They wanted to make a short Teams interview, which I accepted since I wanted to have the Interview Training, but would only consider them if they would be a really great fit.

So far so good, we arrange an interview for the following Monday at 1 pm in the call.

About 3 Hours after the call, they send me a Teams link via Mail, which was written pretty unprofessionally, and looked like they they hadn't put much thought in it. What I immediately notice was that the Teams Link they send me was for 11:30 am on Monday, not 1 pm like we had agreed upon, which was really strange. So I send them a mail asking when the Interview **really** is, and that I would be fine with both timeframes, but would like to know when. I get a response back about 2 hours later, saying that the other employee that would be present can't get to it at 1 pm, so they decided to move the Interview. I immediately see the red flag, they had just moved the Interview, without talking to me first, and didnt even think of telling me. I shrug it off and told them it was fine, since I was not planning on taking the job anyways.

Fast forward to Monday 11:30 am:

I join the Teams Meeting, they start out with a little small talk/chit-chat. And we proceed to the Interview. They talk a little about what they do (at max 2 minutes) and then ask me to introduce myself, which I do and then we just do a standard interview which goes great for the most part. What they really emphasized at multiple points, was that they wanted to have an Intern for ""A long time"" so they were really straight forward, asking me for how many years I will study CS (probably so they can know for how long they can get away with paying me less), and proceed to talk about how they ""Keep their Interns for a long time"".

Then one of them starts to list all the people in their branch, which was weird, since he didn't list a single Data Scientist (The role that the internship was for), which made me suspicious. Then, in the middle of the Interview I get to ask some Questions, so I ask what they will expect from the intern and what kind of task he be responsible for. When they answered I immediately thought ""Wow, that sounds alot like a Python Developer Role, not Data Science"", which made sense since they kept asking for my python skills, which as itself is not a problem since I am very comfortable with my Python knowledge, but it made me really sceptical, so I keep asking more specific Questions until im am certain of it. Since I was 100% sure that this wasn't a DS Role and I was not worried of not getting the Job, I ask ""Why did you call the Job listing Data Science when it sounds alot like a Python Developer Role?"". The answer was not what I thought, one of the Interviewers straight up told me to my face that they ""knew it was not a DS role, but decided to call it that anyway since its such a great buzzword, and they would get a lot more applicants that way"" (this is as close to a 100% quote as I can recall, so this is not exaggerated) , which really made me speechless. After that I just decided to play nice until the Interview was over, but had already decided that I was not going to take their offer, if they would make me one.

Fast Forward 2 Weeks:

After they had told me that they would get back to me by the end of the Week, they didn't, and after two weeks I receive an Email that they had decided for another applicant (that poor dude). My guess is that they smelled that I didn't want to take the job anyways and if I did, I would not stay for long since it became pretty clear that I knew they were full of shit.

"Hi all,

I recently came across the original [Tidy Data paper](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10) (if you haven't read this, check it out- I wish I had a long time ago) and have been thinking a lot about how to best reorganize data from my experiments to make analyses and visualization easier. However, my datasets seem kind of unconventional and I haven't found great examples for how to best tidy them.

Basically, I continuously collect rodent behavioral data in sessions that span 60 trials. I collect **timestamps** of events of interest (e.g. lever press, trial start). So my data looks something like this currently (I've been playing with both Matlab structs and Python pandas.dataframes). For simplicity I shortened this example to just 3 trials. 

&amp;#x200B;

|subject|group|date|trialType|trialStart|behaviorA|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|0|20210601|\[0,0,1\]|\[10,40,60\]|\[8,12,42,65\]|
|2|1|20210601|\[0,0,1\]|\[10,40,60\]|\[15,22,26,48,53\]|
|3|0|20210601|\[0,0,1\]|\[10,40,60\]|\[12,42,80\]|
|1|0|20210602|\[0,0,1\]|\[10,40,60\]|\[4,22,45,63\]|
|2|1|20210602|\[0,0,1\]|\[10,40,60\]|\[30,44,68\]|
|3|0|20210602|\[0,0,1\]|\[10,40,60\]|\[12,29,43,63,68\]|

&amp;#x200B;

Notice that the events contain arrays of multiple values, which makes it ""untidy"". Currently I have one row per subject per date (this corresponds to my raw data files). While this organization is intuitive to me, it seems to make it harder to conveniently plot and analyze the data using readily available packages.

In order to have a single value, I was thinking of reorganizing it so that each row corresponds to a time bin in every file. Instead of event timestamps, the events would be binary coded so that a 1 would be placed at the corresponding timestamp and would be 0 otherwise. It would look like:

&amp;#x200B;

|subject|group|date|timeBin|trialStart|trialType|behaviorA|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|0|20210601|1|0|0|0|
|1|0|20210601|2|0|0|0|
|1|0|20210601|3|1|2|0|
|1|0|20210601|4|0|0|0|
|1|0|20210601|5|0|0|1|
|1|0|20210601|6|0|0|0|

My event timestamps are sampled at 10ms resolution and I have a few hundred files so this could get huge but I guess I could downsample by rounding the timestamps. 

This dataset is pretty much the ""template"" of most of my datasets but I also have more complex datasets where I am continuously tracking a variable over time (e.g. I have video recordings I can use to track position &amp; velocity) so I think organizing things by timestamp may effectively translate to those in the long run?

An alternative would be to have one row for each trial, but this wouldn't be effective if I am also collecting a continuous variable.

"Hey, I haven't been getting long, solid responses from this sub in overall, but I'm gonna try again. Hope someone can shed some pointers anyway!

So we don't have a system in place for data, and I'm tasked with setting it all up. There's a few mariadb servers that have to be piped to a centralised data store for BI. There's also data from Facebook Marketing API that I'd ideally like a pre-built connector for.

Several criteria are: No vendor lock-in if possible, low volumes of data, but needed in real-time and incrementally sync'ed. Not using cloud db's since our volumes don't justify the need for it, plus prefer to keep things local.

What's the best way to go about doing this? Some of the options I've considered:

\- use a pipeline like Stitch (but that's rather expensive for this use case) and so I've considered Airbyte but this open source software is still very immature, despite some help from the nice people over there.

\- Tried using Clickhouse replication but it doesn't work for mariadb

\- considering something hybrid with Airflow (or the newer [Prefect.io](https://Prefect.io)) to schedule and pipe data. This probably also means using some manually-coded connectors?

Data warehouse DB is not selected yet either. I'm thinking, for this use case, something simple like Clickhouse or Postgres (though this one isn't exactly an OLAP).

Preferably, I'd use pre-built solutions, since code is not my forte, but I am open to considering simple, easily debuggable code solutions.

This ends up being sometimes hundreds of lines of data, with a lot of stuff (strings, numbers, tables in tables, etc). Since the data is live during development, I end up wanting to change it a lot, add and remove things, etc. It obviously gets unwieldy doing it right in the editor, editing hundreds of lines. Previously I’ve made Google Sheets to handle it. I love spreadsheets but even I will admit this is cumbersome:

    =""M.map_info[hash(""""""&amp;B3&amp;"""""")] = {script_require = """"maps.map_codes.""&amp;B3&amp;"""""", display_name=[[""&amp;E3&amp;""]], biome = """"""&amp;C3&amp;"""""", max_level=""&amp;P3&amp;"", min_level=""&amp;Q3&amp;"", store_level_cap=""&amp;R3&amp;"", player_tint_add = vmath.vector4(""&amp;S3&amp;"",""&amp;T3&amp;"",""&amp;U3&amp;"",""&amp;V3&amp;""), player_tint_subtract = vmath.vector4(""&amp;W3&amp;"",""&amp;X3&amp;"",""&amp;Y3&amp;"",""&amp;Z3&amp;""), cloud =""&amp;M3&amp;"", border = ""&amp;N3&amp;"", map_zoom = ""&amp;O3&amp;"", music = {id=""""""&amp;H3&amp;"""""", force=""&amp;I3&amp;"", ambient=""""""&amp;K3&amp;"""""", ambient_multiplier=""&amp;L3&amp;"", rest_time=""&amp;J3&amp;""}}""    

Generally speaking, tables might look something like this:    
{a_number = 2, a_string = ""string here"", subtable = {3}},    
{a_number = 4, a_string = ""another_string"", subtable = {}},    
{a_number = 8, a_string = ""yet_another_string"", subtable = {3,5,7,11,13,17,19}},    

The main stumbling block ends up being the subtables, which can have none, one, or multiple values. I haven't figured out a good way to handle this in a spreadsheet. I can either begin entering comma-delineated values manually (this is bad because it’s manual, makes it hard to keep track of the data, and eventually begins resembling the reason I implemented the spreadsheet in the first place), or I have x number of columns for each individual data point in the subtable (this is bad because it is cumbersome to set up and implies a maximum number of entries in a subtable).    

Does this make sense? Is there a better way to handle this? Some kind of tool (free is great, but I'll pay to make my life easier)?

For this particular example, I am using the [DeepFashion](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html) dataset where given an image containing say a shirt, you show top 5 clothes most similar to a shirt. A subset of this has 289,222 diverse clothes images in it. Each image is of shape: (300, 300, 3).

The approach I have includes:

1. Train an autoencoder
2. Feed each image in the dataset through the encoder to get a reduced n-dimensional latent space representation. For example, it can be 100-d latent space representation
3. Create a table of shape m x (n + 2) where 'm' is the number of images and each image is compressed to n-dimensions. One of the column is the image name and the other column is a path to where the image is stored on your local system
4. Given a new image, you feed it through the encoder to get the n-dimensional latent space representation
5. Use something like cosine similarity, etc to compare the n-d latent space for new image with the table m x (n + 2) obtained in step 3 to find/retrieve top k closest clothes

How do I create the table mentioned in step 3?

"Are statistical models in theory able to make predictions about individuals? Suppose you have an individual with observed covariate information (x = a, y = b, z = c) : in theory, can a regression model (trained well on some data) predict the expected value of this individual's response variable?

I heard today that statistical models are not designed to make predictions about individuals. They are only designed to predict the average behavior of a large group of individuals - and in theory, should not be used to make predictions about individuals.

Is this correct? Does this mean that any time statistical models are used to make individual predictions, this is going against the intended use of statistical models?

If I understand correctly: this means that when a statistical model makes a prediction about an individual with observed covariate information (x = a, y = b, z = c) - it's making a prediction for the behavior of ALL individuals in the universe with observed covariate information (x = a, y = b, z = c) .

"EDIT: I'll post this in stack overflow: I forgot about the subreddit's rules.

&amp;#x200B;

I have made a query  with the file ""Sample - Superstore.csv"" from [https://github.com/mikemooreviz/superstore](https://github.com/mikemooreviz/superstore) that will give me the count for each case that contains some type of criteria for strings, as well as a count without any of the previous criteria for the other counts.

The column with the strings that will be analyzed is ""CustomerName"".

&amp;#x200B;

Basically: count for number of clients where the full name starts with an upper case ""A"", number of clients where the full name has a lower case ""t"", number of clients where the full name finishes with a lower case ""n"", then the number of clients where the full names don't have any of the previous criteria.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the query in pandas:

&amp;#x200B;

    import pandas as pd;import numpy as np;import re;
    
    df = pd.read_csv(""path_of_csv_file"",sep="";"");
    
    pd.set_option('display.max_rows', None);pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None);pd.set_option('display.width', None);pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None);
    
    df['strings_conditions'] = np.where(df['CustomerName'].str.startswith(""A""),
    				    'Starts with a capital A',
    				    np.where(df['CustomerName'].str.contains(""t""),
    					  'Has a non-capitalized t',
    					     np.where(df['CustomerName'].str.endswith(""n""),
    						      'Finishes with a non-capitalized n',
    						      'Something else')))
    df_new = df.loc[:,['strings_conditions','CustomerName']].drop_duplicates().dropna()
    
    df_new.groupby(['strings_conditions'])['strings_conditions'].count()

&amp;#x200B;

which gives the following results:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|strings\_conditions|count|
|:-|:-|
|Finishes with a non-capitalized n|100|
|Has a non-capitalized t|288|
|Something else|341|
|Starts with a capital A|64|

&amp;#x200B;

but the same query in SQLite:

&amp;#x200B;

    SELECT 'Finishes with a non-capitalized n' AS strings_conditions, count(*) 
    FROM 
    (
    SELECT CustomerName
    FROM mag_correction
    WHERE mag_correction.CustomerName glob ""*n""
    GROUP by CustomerName
    )
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT 'Has a non-capitalized t' AS strings_conditions, count(*) 
    FROM 
    (
    SELECT CustomerName
    FROM mag_correction
    WHERE mag_correction.CustomerName glob ""*t*""
    GROUP by CustomerName
    )
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT 'Something else' AS strings_conditions, count(*) 
    FROM 
    (
    SELECT CustomerName
    FROM mag_correction
    WHERE mag_correction.CustomerName NOT glob ""A*""
    AND mag_correction.CustomerName NOT glob ""*t*""
    AND mag_correction.CustomerName NOT glob ""*n""
    GROUP by CustomerName
    )
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT 'Starts with a capital A' AS strings_conditions, count(*) 
    FROM 
    (
    SELECT CustomerName
    FROM mag_correction
    WHERE mag_correction.CustomerName glob ""A*""
    GROUP by CustomerName
    )

&amp;#x200B;

gives me:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|strings\_conditions|count|
|:-|:-|
|Finishes with a non-capitalized n|187|
|Has a non-capitalized t|313|
|Something else|341|
|Starts with a capital A|64|

&amp;#x200B;

Would anybody know why this happening? Two of the count results are the same, but I'm don't know where I have gone wrong for the other two.

&amp;#x200B;

If any clarification is needed, I'll happily provide more.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: creating a view in SQLite exactly like df\_new in pandas with the following query:

    SELECT
    CASE 
    WHEN CustomerName glob ""*n"" THEN ""Finishes with a non-capitalized n"" 
    WHEN CustomerName glob ""*t*"" THEN ""Has a non-capitalized t"" 
    WHEN CustomerName NOT glob ""A*""
    AND CustomerName NOT glob ""*t*""
    AND CustomerName NOT glob ""*n""
    THEN ""Something else""
    WHEN CustomerName glob ""A*"" THEN ""Starts with a capital A"" 
    END strings_conditions,
    CustomerName
    FROM mag_correction
    GROUP by CustomerName

Then querying it:

    SELECT df_new.strings_conditions, count(*)
    FROM df_new
    GROUP by df_new.strings_conditions

Gives once again a bunch of different results (except for two rows compared to the other SQLite query):

&amp;#x200B;

|strings\_conditions|count|
|:-|:-|
|Finishes with a non-capitalized n|187|
|Has a non-capitalized t|234|
|Something else|341|
|Starts with a capital A|31|

&amp;#x200B;

"I consistently see/hear people advice others - especially early in their careers - not to job hop.

""It will look bad on your resume""

""No one will want to hire you""

""No one becomes VP if they can't show they can stay at one place"".

That may apply in other careers (and honestly, I don't think it does, but whatever) - but ***especially in data science*** it's just terrible, terrible advice.

*Unless your current company is giving you 8% yearly raises and 20%+ comp increases with each promotion, you should be looking for another job within 2 years.*

EDIT: To be clear, if you're not getting 20% increases in comp you should be looking for opportunities that *will* offer you *at least* 20% increases in comp. I'm not saying you should take lateral moves just because you're not getting big enough increases. Make every move count. And you should be able to. 

There are 4 core reasons why:

**Experienced Data Science talent is in incredibly high demand**

If you have 1+ years of legit data science experience, you likely won't have trouble finding companies to offer you a job. I was trying to hire a guy recently who ended up with 4 offers on the table, including one that was 50% higher than the one I gave him. That is what the world is looking like right now.

Which means that even if you're flagged as a ""job hopper"", the reality is that most companies don't have the candidate pool to get picky enough to reject you. They need people. They don't have leverage.

**The fastest way to get a higher-ranking role is to change companies**

This is just basic probability + the previous point. Your company may or may not have a higher role for you to move into (and that's assuming they would even be interested in promoting you). In contrast, there are 100s of companies out there with openings at levels higher than you. Waiting for a role to open up at your company is just a bad gamble.

When I look at people that joined my first job at the same time as I did - and mind you - people I thought were just as if not *more* capable than me - I am now 2/3 titles above them. And it's all because I was able to get bigger titles as I switched jobs.

**The ""job hopper"" red flag is self-correcting**

Say you jump jobs every 6 months 3 times in a row. You would *surely* become a ""job hopper, do not hire"" candidate after that... until you weren't.

See, if no one hires you for a new job for 2, 3, 4 years... eventually someone is going to look at your resume and say ""hey, they job hopped a bunch for a bit, but now they've been at job X for like 3 years... we should give this person a chance"".

For every hiring manager, there is a number Y of consecutive years at one job that will undo whatever previous job-hopping behavior there was prior.

**Internal compensation increases are lower than external ones 99% of the time**

Listen, if your company is giving you 10% yearly raises and 25% promotion raises - by all means, stay. That's a great company.

If you're like the rest of us, getting 2-4% raises and 10-15% comp increases when you get a promotion, and you're getting promoted every 2.5 years on average (or less), then the math just doesn't work out.

Here's some very real data from my 8 year career:

Average total comp increase (without promotion): 2%

Average total comp increase (with promotion): 12%

Average time-till-promotion: 2 years.

Average total comp increase (changing jobs): 28%

If I had stayed at one job for 8 years, my current comp would probably be somewhere around 50%-60% of what it is now - and that is in large part because I took a new job for a 25% raise after being with one company for only 6 months.

Was it risky in that some employers may look at that 6 month tenure as a problem? Probably. But it hasn't stopped at least some substantial number of companies to continue to pursue me.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now, let's pause here. Some of you will say ""well, I applied to one job once and didn't get it, so I know that no one wants to hire me"".

I had a roommate in college that gave me great life advice disguised as terrible dating advice.

His dating advice was ""listen, the reason I get so many girls is that I go out and I hit on 30, 40 girls every night. And every one of them but one will tell me ""no"", but as long as one of them says ""yes"" that's all you need"".

So I never followed that advice for dating, but you should 100% follow it for job searching. There are 100s of jobs out there for which you're qualified. If you're currently employed and in no rush to leave your job, continuously keep applying to any job that you would consider an upgrade over your current one. Obviously make sure the effort is worth the payout - don't go doing week-long take-home assignments for jobs that suck, but pick and choose jobs that are good fits, pay well, look cool, and put some effort into applying for them.

You will get told no a *lot* at first. And then you'll get better at cleaning up your resume, better at interviewing, better at take-homes, etc. Because the only way to get better at those things is to practice.

And then eventually you'll start making it to the final rounds of some interview processes. But probably still get rejected. And then one day you'll get an offer that represents a 40% increase in comp and you'll be sitting there thinking ""wait, what the hell?"".

**TL;DR: job hop aggressively, especially if early in your career. Don't let blanket advice about how job hopping is bad deter you from doing what is going to almost surely be substantial leaps in your career and comp.**

EDIT:

If it wasn't obvious (and maybe it wasn't) there are certainly cases where this advice won't apply.

u/MichaelKamprath pointed out that this may not apply in tech, where you can climb the ladder as an individual contributor and deep expertise may be much more valuable than climbing the management ladder. And I think that is a fair assessment - however one must also recognize this is *not* the case outside of tech where the big salaries are going to come from management roles.

I think it's also fair to say that if compensation isn't a big driver for you - and the quality of the work matters much more, then this may not apply either.",Job Hopping: do it,datascience
"This is the first time I did analysis in MBA, I got the result something like:

SUPPORT    |     CONFIDENCE   |   LIFT  |   RULE

 Does this mean if A is being bought then 85% confidence C will be being purchased too?  If the Lift = 1.2 in the output, then 20% more likely B is to be purchased if A is purchased?

"Recently, quite surprisingly for me but the main focus of my work shifted to time-series forecasting.   
I have read a lot in the great book by Hyndman, but I still have a feeling there are a lot of approaches and methods I haven't tried. Currently, my baseline approach is Facebook Prophet to which I add a few custom regressors and try to find the optimal values for the hyperparameters mentioned in the official documentation.   
There are some special traits in the data I work with. Due to how billing is implemented, there are some significant spikes on the 28th of each month and then there might be a sudden drop in the next few days (29-31). Adding regressors helps, but not that much because those values (28-31) might be unexpectedly high or low. 

I have also tried Greykite by Linkedin. This library is quite new and is supposedly better than Prophet at least according to their own blog post. I find it much more challenging and confusing to work with though, and their documentation has yet to be improved in order to be coherent and readable.

"Hey all! You might remember me from the Data Science Cheatsheet I posted a few months ago ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ljftgi/i_created_a_fourpage_data_science_cheatsheet_to/)). The support from that was incredible, and I thought I’d share an update.

Since then, I’ve gone through a dozen interviews, ranging from FANG to startups to MBB, and updated the cheatsheet with topics I’ve seen covered in actual interviews.

Improvements include:

* Added Time Series
* Added Statistics
* Added A/B Testing
* Improved Distribution Section
* Added Multi-class SVM
* Added HMM
* Miscellaneous Section
* And a bunch of other small changes scattered throughout!

These topics, along with the material covered previously, are all condensed in a convenient five-page Data Science Cheatsheet, found [here](https://github.com/aaronwangy/Data-Science-Cheatsheet).

I’ll be heading to a FANG company as a DS after graduation, and I hope this cheatsheet is helpful to those on the job hunt or just looking to brush up on machine learning concepts. Feel free to leave any suggestions and star/save the repo for reference and future updates!

"Hey guys, if anyone of you has experience with twint, I would greatly appreciate a few tipps here. I tried for like 2 days now to get this working (trial and error, youtube vids and medium articles mostly... I knew nothing about coding before and I might add that I still have no clue)

I have this written down, it describes my main problems:

 

### Command Ran:

import twint  
import pandas

import nest\_asyncio  
nest\_asyncio.apply()

c = twint.Config()  
c.Search = ""EURO2020""  
c.Since = ""2021-06-19""  
c.Until = ""2021-06-20""  
c.Custom = \['time','username','tweet','likes','link'\]   ## &lt;-- This is the problem line  
c.Store\_csv = True  
c.Output = ""Test\_EM2020""

twint.run.Search(c)

### Description of Issue

I am very new to all of this, lets just say that as a disclaimer. I  want to scrape all tweets that happen during specific EURO 2020 football  games. I tried my best to get everything working, but I have no idea  what I am doing to be honest. the pandas, and asyncio line I got form a  YouTube Channel, it doesn't seem to be working if I leave them out, so I  kept them.

The general Scraping seems to work fine, but there are several things that I want to do that give me error messages:

&amp;#x200B;

1. When I try to slim the csv down by only scraping for the stuff i need  (not much, see my c.Custom), I get the message  ""CRITICAL:root:twint.output:\_output:CSV:Error:list indices must be  integers or slices, not str list indices must be integers or slices, not  str"". I have no idea what that means, but I am confused because I am  not asking anything new by my wanted parameters - they are in the csv  when i do not filter, so it doesn't make sense to me why I get an error  message when I look for less attributes.  
 
2. I really want to keep only Englisch and German messages, but the  c.Lang = ""de"" line doesn't seem to be doing anything, same as the  Englisch one. I also do not know how I can combine the two, so looking  only for ""en"" and ""de""  
 
3. Right now what I still need to do is go into Excel and re-format the  first column with the seperators. That does work, but is an extra step  that I am shure can be automated somehow - I just don't know how.  
 

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated. I don't know if this  is the right place to ask, but I found no ""discussion"" forum or  something of the sort. Thanks for reading anyways!

I have been admitted to the Master of Applied Data Science (MADS) - Online at the University of Michigan to start in Fall 2021:

[https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/master-applied-data-science-online](https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/master-applied-data-science-online)

Does anyone have any insights on the program? If I understand correctly, the program is very new and the first cohort of students must be about to graduate now. I would love to read the experience of some people that have taken the program and whether they thought it was worth it as well as any objective opinions in general.

I have found very few first-hand opinions on the MADS at Michigan out there, and the opinions that I have read (mostly here on reddit) were on the negative side. Given that other schools such as Georgia Tech have tons of overwhelmingly positive opinions -both on the quality of the classes as well as the price-, I am scared this is not the right move for me. It is a big investment in terms of time and money after all.

* Bachelor in Economics (10 years ago)
* 5+ years of Data Analytics work in large tech company in Bay AreA
* Obtained 2 professional certificates at UC Berkeley Extension: 1 in Programming, 1 in Data Science
   * Medium Proficiency in Python, SQL + Statistics/Probability
* I intend to take degree in 3 years (while working full-time)
* I can afford the tuition (\~$45k before employer contributions) if program is worth it. It won't put me into hardship or debt. 
* What I want to get from the degree: applied knowledge that I can use at the workplace to move onto more technical roles. 
   * Also, a degree that will 'officially' open the doors to the mentioned roles, as many positions state that a Masters Degree is the minimum required qualification.
* If I were to decline the offer, my current options are not many:
   * Master of Science in Data Science at Colorado Boulder (everyone is 'admitted' through their Introduction courses that take place every 3 months): https://www.colorado.edu/program/data-science/coursera-overview
   * Apply to other schools for the Spring 2022 semester (Georgia Tech would be the first target; any other recommendations?)",Admitted to the Master of Applied Data Science (MADS) - Online at the University of Michigan - Thoughts?,datascience

"Here's the hypothetical from the interviewer:

FB launched a Zoom-like feature. It was generally well-accepted and its usage is growing.

You work at Instagram. How would you evaluate if IG should add that Zoom-like feature?

(in other words, a synchronous communication app within a heterogeneous network (FB) is being evaluted for launch in an otherwise asynchronous homogenous network (IG).

My response:

Clarifying questions:

\- Can some people use the FB Zoom feature with a higher / different  access level than others?

\- What requirements, minimums, or thresholds must be achieved in order to obtain higher access (such as:

o a Facebook business page,

o a Facebook business page with  &gt;1,000 followers

o a Facebook user with &gt;500 edges (relationships since [Facebook can process one trillion edge graphs)](https://research.fb.com/publications/one-trillion-edges-graph-processing-at-facebook-scale/) which the people (nodes) desiring higher access must have people

\- Higher access might include: the ability to invite more than 20 people (20 being the number the hypothetical provided); the ability to place other companies’ advertisements in the Zoom invitation, the Zoom meeting, and/or the Zoom follow up notification; the ability to place advertisements of the host’s company in the Zoom invitation, the Zoom meeting, and/or the Zoom follow up notification; a longer Zoom meeting time (&gt;60 minutes for example)

(clarifying questions partially answered but  mostly deferred)

I would review the data from the A/B experiment on this feature's usage and adoption at FB. I imagine this A/B test would have a dependent variable / control group / training set in machine learning (ML) (user behavior before Zoom feature) and an independent variable / test group / test set in ML (user behavior after Zoom feature).  user behavior here would include the following variables which would be available in SQL tables for further analysis: frequency (did it increase or decrease after using this feature; in what ways did it increase or decrease (likes, comments, shares, marketplace (buying or selling), direct chat w/ other nodes (users), creation or removal of certain edges (relationships).

I'd also analyze datasets which tracked:

\- how many invitees became hosts and set up their own FB Zoom meeting within 1,2,3,4 and +4 weeks;

\- How many invitees purchased one of the host’s products that were advertised in the Zoom meeting?

\- How many invitees purchased one of the non-host products that were advertised in the Zoom meeting?

The A/B experiment I'd design at IG:

Dependent variable / control group / training set: IG user behavior before Zoom feature

Independent variable / test group / test set: IG user behavior after Zoom feature

user behavior here would include the following variables which would be available in SQL tables for further analysis: frequency (did it increase or decrease after using this feature; in what ways did it increase or decrease (likes, comments, shares, marketplace (buying or selling), direct chat w/ other nodes (users), creation or removal of certain edges (relationships).

Last, I'd run an SQL inner join of the networks of people who used FB Zoom  and the networks of those same people on IG. I'd use clustering ML (entropy weight k-means) to then look for trends or patterns which might explain why the Zoom feature was used more (or less) on FB than IG; which gender uses the Zoom feature more; which network (IG or FB) leads to more Zoom invites being sent out; do IG or FB Zoom meetings lead to more purchases? What type of purchases (category)? What price range? How does price, category and frequency of purchase vary based on GIS or location data of Zoom host and location of invitees?

"Hi, I am a CS major. I graduated in 2019 and have been working in a company since then.

When I joined, they had just started an AI team. In fact, my manager was the first data science hire and I was the second one. We have been working on creating an MVP, and don't have any customers for it yet.

My manager is more inclined towards the business side of data science (so he's good in storytelling in demos, working with Sales and Product Management for the requirements etc.). We don't have any expert for guidance on ML product pipelines, algorithm improvement etc. so anything I have implemented so far has been by taking help from the internet.

As a college fresher, I got this job through a Python interview. I even left an offer of 2.5x pay in software development because I wanted to pursue data science.

I haven't interviewed for any other company since then. I don't really know what is usually involved in data science jobs. Have I gained any useful data science experience in order to get the next job?

My work involves:

\- setting up internal products on demo servers and preparing a story through dummy data/insights for customer demos or security conferences (40%)

\- designing database tables and creating reports and dashboards for the product (initially it was in PowerBI, then Jasper Reports and now in an internal product framework) (25%)

\- developing and maintaining Python jobs and integrating model training/detection with the main Java product through Flask (20%)

\- exploring, drawing analogies and implementing unsupervised ML/DL algorithms that can solve the use cases provided by Product Management. (15%)

"What are others’ thoughts on paying your own way to attend conferences directly related to your job? Is it common practice?  Are there salary ranges or other criteria you consider when making this kind of choice?

Back story: I used to work as a government contractor and we were only allowed to attend one conference per year. On that salary, I really couldn’t afford to pay my own way so I only went and presented at one. I recently changed jobs to a small startup, with a 25% pay increase but no real benefits to speak of yet (VERY small and new startup). There’s a conference that is squarely in line with my job description and potentially really important because of both the subject matter and the focus.  The boss is leaning towards only sending one of us and having that person take screenshots. Honestly, I don’t think this is functional for two reasons: 1) if I’m at a conference I want to focus on it and not be taking screenshots like crazy for 4 days, and 2) if I’m not at the conference, screenshots are not going to be useful to me really.  So I’m considering just paying for it myself ($500).  It will mean I can’t get (right away) the new computer I also need for my job, but this conference is really important for both me and the person who signaled it to the boss (and would get to go...that’s only fair and I’m totally ok with it).  However, paying my own way also sends a signal that I’m happy to do this going forward - which I am not. Conferences are expensive, and as a W2 employee they are not tax-deductible.

"I work on a ""Data Science"" team that does work that is hybrid of typical DS/DE/DA work.

Some days it's simple SQL and Tableau, other times its building pipelines through real time ingestion with kafka or batch ETLs using Airflow, sometimes it's hard statistical analysis and occasionally we do actual Machine Learning... 

We are all Data Scientists by title but play the hybrid of just being good with data, regardless of specifics coming to DA versus DE versus DS..

Recently I've felt like I've been missing the DS side of things. I get the occasional one off request for building data models but don't ever really deploy anything with them... Usually just local models and then sharing the results.

I am wanting to start putting some models ""in production"" as a way to show my usual stakeholders the value that ML can have for the business and I'm curious in all the ways you guys do this on your team? I specifically am curious about two scenarios...

**Scenario 1: Model only needs to be running when the ETL runs.** 

Most of our work is batch processing data at some interval. I typically utilize airflow with kubernetes pod operators to spin up python containers that have the code I need for the ETL. I figured a super simple way to do this was to just store a trained model in the container itself and have the scripts run the models the same way I would locally whenever the airflow job is triggered. This seems simple, but I'm sure my idea is flawed. I know a major limitation here is that to retrain the model, I need to pull my container back to my local machine, retrain the model locally, rebuild the container and push it back to artifactory so the ETL can now use the updated version. There's also the limitation that other people can't use the model since its only present ""in production"" when airflow triggers the pod to spin up.

**Scenario 2: Model needs to be available and running at all times**

I often utilize kafka triggers deployed in kubernetes pods to listen to topics of interest. While they usually just write data to a db or send notifications to stakeholders about the event that occurred, I see a lot of potential in being able to point data from an event into a classification or regression model in real time and then store the results of the model for later use. To do this, I think my approach would be to build a flask API that is deployed in the same kubernetes cluster that I could point my kafka trigger towards... I have played with flask before, but am not as great with the whole devops side in terms of configuring IPs and making sure my flask API is available for other ""apps"" to use...

I went to my (grad) school networking event, pitched myself to a company, and got offered a managerial role. My responsibility is building out data solutions such as dashboards, analytics, and ML models, in addition to overseeing a small data process/ETL team.

Asides from the increased workload, this role requires 5 days in-office and the commute is 40+ min one way. There's no plan to move to hybrid in near future. I also have no experience in managing a team, let alone doing that while building out data functions from scratch.

Now the plus side is, it's a 20% increase in total comp. I have a lot of say in how the data analytics will run. Lastly, the chance of managerial experience seems to be valuable and rare.

I'm not too worried about delivering the technical aspect of work. I have experience building out dashboard, db, and pipeline.

The project that I’m working right now is about image recognition. For the data pipeline we are using the following pipeline:
- Take photos with our cellphones
- Divide them into batches of 100 (called tasks), Upload them into CVAT (hosted in a aws machine) and label them
- Download the images/labels to our local machines
- Add some additional metadata to the labels and upload them to a aws s3 bucket. 

This has some manual labor as there is label happening all the time and it would be desirable that the s3 bucket would have the updated information without much of an hassle. 

What would you suggest in this case? What tools that you would think to automate this process?

"I  started a DS position 4 monts ago, Today I had an informal presentation  where I introduced an object detection system (Detectron) to my team  and I'm a bit frustrated.

The  level of expertise of my team (Including me) is not too high in DS, DL or  ML, so my role is that of the person who studies, understands and  explains models to the senior developers who are trying to break into DS  field. I really worked hard during past week but I have the feeling  that I was not able to transfer all the knowledge to my collegues. I  could not answer some question and I think that my boss is not  completely satisfied. I think one of the problem is the mathematical and  statistical complex of the models, metrics evaluations,etc. Sometimes  trying to understand everything can take months and even working hard  It's always something that you are not able to anwser.

I  would like to know How do you face with this complexity? How do you  prepare your presentations in which you have to explain models and  Mathematical concepts in understandable way? and where do you focus when  you have to understand a model? The architecture? The training process?  the evaluation process?

"Going to graduate in the summer and been applying for jobs in DS. Looking at some of the requirements though is making me feel overwhelmed with how much I need to know such as AI, all the different models, coding in at least 3 different languages, DS issues such as underfitting, variance, bias and how to overcome them and other methods and terminologies.

And once I look up these terms and methods I feel like I've forgotten it within a few days, and feel like once I've got an interview or technical questions I'll do really bad in them because I'd have forgotten or don't know.

"Hi, ime doing a course on Data Analysis, so I guess this is the correct place to ask this.

In the course, we were told

* A **hypothesis** is a possible explanation for something, which serves as a starting point for further investigation.
* The **Null Hypothesis** assumes the opposite of what you think is going on – often no change -  and it is your job to disprove it.
* The **Alternate Hypothesis** is usually what you assume,  and can be considered the case with some certainty if the null hypothesis is disproven.

This is confusing me and I think it is just wrong.  

I was doing some research and found [https://microbenotes.com/null-and-alternative-hypothesis/](https://microbenotes.com/null-and-alternative-hypothesis/).

It is saying.

*  The **null hypothesis** is a general statement that states that there is no relationship between two phenomenons under consideration or that there is no association between two groups.
* A **hypothesis**, in general, is an assumption that is yet to be proved with sufficient pieces of evidence. A null hypothesis thus is the hypothesis a researcher is trying to disprove.
* An alternative hypothesis is a statement that describes that there is a relationship between two selected variables in a study.
* An alternative hypothesis is usually used to state that a new theory is preferable to the old one (null hypothesis).

Not sure if I am any less confused.  It seems to be going round in circles.  It feels like the alternative hypothesis and hypothesis are the same, kind on.

So I work for a company based in the U.S. and it has a delivery service for its stores. I basically have the job of identifying which of these stores' delivery service is performing poorly. It's a bitch to do manually because there are hundreds of them and the only tools I have are Excel and the data given to me from the Tableau dashboards made by the data scientists at the company (I have no access to make my own, and was denied previously when asked; Also, I don't even know Tableau that well so I'm sure it wouldn't be any help anyways if I did have access).

My strategy currently is to use metrics such as on time delivery (% of orders delivered on time), and driver delivery rate (% of orders placed that were picked up by drivers). I check the z-scores of these metrics and compare them to the rest of the stores and if it has a z-score less than -2 I highlight it as an outlier. However, since the target metric is 100% for each of these metrics, isn't the data skewed making what I am doing invalid? How can I make difference of mean analyses with skewed data like this? While this framework does capture some of the poor performing stores, its scope is really poor.

I would really appreciate help with this because this has been really stressing me out and I am very underqualified and underpaid for this.

# On BigTech

I’d like to provide an overview over the steps of Big Tech companies that recruit for Data Scientist positions in the EU. I will copy this straight from my notes so all of these come from actual interviews. If there’s no salary info it means I didn’t get to discuss it with them because I dropped out of the process for whatever reason before I ended up signing my offer. In total I spoke with around 40 companies and ended up having 3 different offers, went to 6 final round interviews and stopped some processes because I found a great match in the meantime.

**Booking.com**

Salary: €95k + 15pct Bonus

Interviews:

1. Recruiter call
2. Hackerrank test (2 questions, 1 multiple choice, 1 exercise)
3. 2 Technical interviews:
   1. 20 minutes past projects, real case from Booking for solving it,
   2. Second interview: different case, same system
4. Behavorial interview

**Spotify**

Salary: €85-€90k + negotiable bonus

Process:

1. Recruiter call
2. Hiring manager interview, mostly behavorial but there was some exercise on Bayes’ Theorem that involved calculating some probabilities and using conditional + total probability.
3. Technical screening, coding exercise (Python / SQL). SQL was easy but they do ask Leetcode questions!
4. Presentation + Case Study (take home)
5. Modeling exercise
6. Stakeholder interview

**Facebook/Meta (Data Scientist - Product Analytics)**

I lost my notes but the process was very concise! Regardless of the product, their recruitment process was one of the most pleasant ones I’ve had. Also they have TONS of prep material. I think it went down like this:

1. Recruiter call
2. Technical screen SQL, but you can also use Python / pandas. Actually they said they’re flexible so you could probably even ask for doing it in R
3. Product interviews (onsite)

**Zalando**

I did not have any recruiter call, they just sent me an invitation for the tech screen and there would be only 2 steps involved

1. Technical screening with probability brainteaser (Think of dice throwing and expected value of a certain value after N iterations), explaining logistic regression „mathematically“, live coding (in my case implement TF-IDF) and a/b testing case
2. Onsite with 3-4 interviews

**Wolt**

1. Recruiter screen
2. Hiring manager interview, mostly behavioral
3. Take home assignment. This one is BIG, the deadline was 10 days and they wanted an EDA, training &amp; fitting multiple ML models on a classification task, and then also doing a high level presentation for another case without any data
4. Discussion of the take home + technical questions
5. Stakeholder interview

**DoorDash**

1. Recruiter screen
2. Technical screen + Product case. Think of SQL questions in the technical but you can also use R or Python. They ask 4 questions in 30 mins so be quick! Product case is very generic.
3. Onsite interview with mostly product cases and behaviorals

**Delivery Hero**

1. Recruiter interview
2. Hiring manager interview
3. Codility test, SQL + Python
4. Panel interview: 3 people from the team, focus on behavioural
5. Stakeholder interview: largely behavioural
6. Bar raiser interview: this is Amazon style, live coding + technical questions

# Some other mentions:

**Amazon + Uber**

Sorry, they keep ghosting me :D

**Klarna**

Just a hint: they’re hiring as crazy for data science, I got contacted by them but the recruiter didn’t have any positions that would match my level so we didn’t proceed further. I was a bit sad about this because they’re growing, the product is hot and they may IPO soon.

**QuantCo**

Because I have some different 3rd party recruiter in my mailbox every week: They pay very well, I was told the range is up to 230k / y. 140k base + negotiable spread between bonus and equity. They’re not public so I wouldn’t want to sit on their equity. Anyway, I responded twice to that and got ghosted twice from different recruiters. I would recommend ignoring them.

**Revolut**

They contacted me but I decided to not pursue this further because of their horrible reputation and the way their CEO communicates in public.

**Wayfair**

I interviewed with a couple of people who have worked there before as head of something, no one was particularly excited. I applied there once for a senior data analyst position and they sent me an automated 4 hour long codility test. I opened it but decided to drop out of the process.

# On the general salary situation

For senior data science roles outside of big tech I think a reasonable range to end up at is €70k-90k. In big tech you can expect €80-100k base comp + 10-15% bonus / stocks. I’m sure there’s people who can do a lot better but for me this seemed to be my market value. There are some startups I didn’t want to mention here that can pay pretty well because they’re US backed (they acquire a lot recently), but usually their workload is also a lot higher, so it depends how much you value additional money vs WLB.

[levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) is very (!) accurate if the company is big enough for having data there. Should be the case for all big tech companies btw.

# On interview prep

There’s already great content out there!

While I don’t agree with everything here (like working on weekends and being so religious about the prep), I think the JPM top comment summed up how the prep should be done quite well: [https://www.teamblind.com/post/Have-DS-interviews-gotten-harder-in-the-past-few-years-WbYfzXbE](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Have-DS-interviews-gotten-harder-in-the-past-few-years-WbYfzXbE)

I also read this article many times: [https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ox9h2j/two\_months\_of\_virtual\_faangmula\_ds\_interviews/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ox9h2j/two_months_of_virtual_faangmula_ds_interviews/)

I have to say that I started prepping way too late, basically while I was already knee deep into interviewing, but it worked out well anyway.

**SQL:**

Stratascratch is great if you want to practice for a specific company, but Leetcode will prep you more generally imo. I recommend getting a premium for both actually, even though it's expensive. I just took a one-time monthly subscription (be sure to cancel it immediately after booking it as they will just keep charging you).

**Which Leetcode questions to practice:** [https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/)

I honestly didn’t see a lot of Leetcode style questions but they do sometimes ask about it and then you're happy if you recognize the question

**If you need to dive deep into probability theory:** [https://mathstat.slu.edu/\~speegle/\_book/probchapter.html#probabilitybasics](https://mathstat.slu.edu/~speegle/_book/probchapter.html#probabilitybasics). I honestly bombed all probability brainteasers I got asked. It can make you feel stupid but looking back at my undergrad material (which is a veeeeery long time ago) I realized that I was once upon a time able to answer these kinds of questions, I just don’t need them for work. Given that they’re rarely asked I wouldn’t focus on this too much honestly.

**For general machine learning &amp; stats:**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9V07EIfIg&amp;list=PLOg0ngHtcqbPTlZzRHA2ocQZqB1D\_qZ5V&amp;index=1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9V07EIfIg&amp;list=PLOg0ngHtcqbPTlZzRHA2ocQZqB1D_qZ5V&amp;index=1) This video series was my bible. IMO it covers everything you’ll need in data science interviews about machine learning. Honestly, no-one ever asked me anything more complicated than logistic regression or how random forests work on a high level. For reading things up [I also can’t recommend the ISLR book enough](https://www.statlearning.com/)

**On product interviews:**[https://vimeo.com/385283671/ec3432147b](https://vimeo.com/385283671/ec3432147b) I watched this video by Facebook many times. I think if you use their techniques you’ll easily pass most product interviews.

# On recruiter calls

These are really easy imo, in the later stage I had an 80-90% success rate. I made a script for my intro and it took around 4-5 minutes to say everything. This is quite long also because I make sure I speak slowly and clearly when introducing myself, but the structure is the roughly like this:

1. Brief introduction on background + specializations (if you’re really, I mean REALLY good at ML modeling feel free to mention right in the beginning that this is how you’re perceived at work
2. Overview over your current department / team
3. What is your work mode (e.g. cross functional teams, embedded data scientist, data science team)
4. What kind of projects have you worked on
5. What is the scope of those projects (end-to-end, workshops, short projects). It also helps to give a ballpark of their usual timeframe
6. What are your responsibilities in those projects
7. What is your tech-stack / Alternatively: give examples throughout the projects of where you e.g. work with sklearn, pandas, …

I have made great experiences with that. Usually I apologise if I feel that I was going into too much detail or spoke too long, but so far everyone was fine with this and it is imo a great entry point for further discussions. I use this intro also for every other time I meet someone new.

# On hiring manager calls

These are imo quite easy, it’s usually more about the team fit and you shouldn’t have problems if you prepared with the Facebook material. Have some stories about projects ready as they usually ask you about at least 1 or 2 of them. Get familiar with answering questions in the STAR format.

I sometimes made the experience that they’re a bit pushy with their questions. If you feel that they’re focusing a lot on a specific project where you might feel that it’s not the most relevant for the role I recommend leading the direction politely away from there. I sometimes experienced that they were asking many questions about a rather simple model where I also didn’t do any ETL/database work. I recommend saying something in the way of „while surely an ARIMA model is useful, I would like to emphasise that we normally use it as a baseline because it’s easy to explain, but I do prefer increasing the complexity if the project allows for that, as I did for example in project Z. As this was one of my most impactful projects so far I’d love to elaborate on that as well if you’re okay with that, as I want to give you the best possible overview on my skillset and areas of interest.“ If they keep pushing about that not so relevant project I would consider it a red flag honestly and I had such cases before, even though they were very rare.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyn0CKPuPlA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyn0CKPuPlA)

Let me just leave these here.

# On take home assignments

I’ve done a few of them. I learned a lot from them. I hated every single one of them. I hated Leetcode even more in the beginning, but I’ve started to appreciate it, because take homes are just so arbitrary. As I had advanced talks with a couple companies, I skipped more and more of them. At some point I started telling companies that I don’t have time to do them due to other commitments and pending offers. The ones that were enthusiastic about hiring me moved me forward anyway. The ones where I didn’t leave a great impression told me it’s a requirement. So my advice is: If you’re willing to walk away from the process, decline them. It’s not respectful of our time. In one case I told a company that I can’t do it but I’m happy to explain how I’d approach it in detail in a call, otherwise I’d have to withdraw my application. The take home was very extensive, evaluate a large public dataset, do the EDA, fit some models, build an API, dockerize it and show you’ll make a prediction from the worker. They were a bit unorganised and scheduled a meeting about it, but the one evaluating it was super surprised that I didn’t prepare anything. We ended up coding a toy model and deploying it anyway and they forwarded me in the process anyway. Again, I would only recommend this if you’re willing to walk away from the offer, for me this was 50/50.

# On scheduling interviews

In general, bigger companies move slower, but I would suggest mass applying once you’re talking to a few of your favourites. I started practicing on unimportant roles about 1-2 months before I went hardcore with interviewing. I recommend not accepting any offers too early, the market is crazy right now! However, once you have an offer and you had at least a chat with the recruiter or better the hiring manager for a role, even big tech companies can move quickly! After my first offer I had many processes expedited and completed in 2-3 weeks.

# On anything else

Feel free to ask here. As this is a throwaway I won’t check my DM, but I will try to answer any publicly posted questions. Good luck everyone!",(Hopefully almost) everything you need to know about data science interviews (EU perspective),datascience

"I am working as a data analyst intern at a company of about 250 people. Since I joined, I am assigned on a project with client which involves working on Tableau for 90% of the time and rest of time it involves working with Big Query.

But at the moment our client is busy with some production project of their own and they don't have much time to discuss their needs with us and hence there is not much work left for us since we are done with what they needed and we have meeting in second week of the next month. Until then, there is literally nothing else on my plate.

So instead of wasting my time, I think I should ask my manager to let me work on a different project which involves some machine learning work. 

But I'm afraid, once our client are done with their project, there will be increase in the work load and I'll end up working on 2 projects which will require me to spend a lot of time of my day out of office hours. Now since I am an intern and just starting out my career in this field, I won't mind some extra work given that it'll only help me grow in the future.

But I have my college along side and I am lucky to be working from home which helps me to manage my internship as well as my college. If I take on 2 projects, I'll sure be not able to focus on my academics. And yes I do care about my social life as well which keeps my mind stable and prevents me from burning out

I'm not sure what do I do?

Tl,Dr:  I am a data analyst intern at a small sized company and work on Tableau and Big query. I don't have much work to do at least for about a month when we have a meet scheduled with our client for further proceedings. Till then I wanna take up a new project but I am afraid in doing so, I'll end up working on 2 projects simultaneously which will take up a lot of my time and I wouldn't be able to cope up with my college and my social life.

"Resampling is a widely recommended solution to class imbalance among data scientists.  Resampling also is an awful idea.

Resampling is a take on case-control study designs, in which cases/controls are sampled in ways which do not respect the underlying frequency distribution for either cases or controls. When using logistic regression, [the effects are estimated in an unbiased way](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/558942/why-is-it-that-if-you-undersample-or-oversample-you-have-to-calibrate-your-outpu/558950#558950) but the intercept is biased.  

Additionally, [we probably don't want to be doing classification](https://www.fharrell.com/post/classification/) anyway, we mostly want to be accurately predicting risks for the outcome (risk of churn, risk of click through, whatever).  Ensuring our risk estimates are accurate vis a vis calibration and proper scoring rules allows for an appropriate risk threshold to be selected for decision making.  When you resample, all you're doing is forcing the model's probabilities to change in order to make your arbitrary decision boundary look appropriate.  You're putting the cart before the horse.

[Approaches like SMOTE do not help](https://twitter.com/MaartenvSmeden/status/1495668297630633985) (although who the hell would think that all observations within a convex subset of the feature space would all be for one class?  The idea itself is incredibly suspect to me, but I digress).

TL;DR:  Don't resample when classes are imbalanced.  If you have too few observations of one class, ask yourself if the problem is in need of ML.  Otherwise, ensure your probability predictions are calibrated and select an appropriate decision boundary.

Here is another [good post](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/357466/are-unbalanced-datasets-problematic-and-how-does-oversampling-purport-to-he) should you care.",Stop resampling data in classification problems.,datascience

"When I was working as a data scientist (with a BS), I believed somewhat strongly that Statistics was the proper field for training to become a data scientist--not computer science, not data science, not analytics. Statistics. 

However, now that I'm doing a statistics MS, my perspective has completely flipped. Much of what we're learning is *completely* useless for private sector data science, from my experience. So much pointless math for the sake of math. Incredibly tedious computations. Complicated proofs of irrelevant theorems. Psets that require 20 hours or more to complete, simply because the computations are so intense (page-long integrals, etc.). What's the point?

There's basically no working with data. How can you train in statistics without working with real data? There's no real world value to any of this. My skills as a data scientist/applied statistician are not improving.

"I created a model to predict loan acceptance. We now run this campaign twice a year, once in summer, then once in winter whereas before, we'd only run it in the summer. The summer campaign model performed really well, but the winter campaign is failing.

I actually have a theory as to why it's failing. I think that the people who usually accept the loans in the summer (people paying for vacations, back to school items) are completely different than those who are likely to accept in the winter (taxes!).

My plan is to start by running some data analysis to see if the people who are accepting the loans are different from the summer (age, credit score income, etc.).

"# Update/TLDR:

This post garnered a lot more support and informative responses than I anticipated - thank you to everyone who contributed.

I thought it would be beneficial to others to summarize the key takeaways.

I compiled top-level notions for your perusal, however, I would still suggest going through the comments as there are a lot of very informative and thought-provoking discussions on these topics.

&amp;#x200B;

**Interview Question:**

&gt;"" What if you run another test for another problem, alpha = .05 and you get a p-value = .04999 and subsequently you run it once more and get a p-value of .05001?""

The question was surrounded around the idea of accepting/rejecting the null hypothesis.  I believe the interviewer was looking for - How I would interpret the results. Why the p-value changed.  Not much additional information or context was given. 

**Suggested Answers:**

* u/bolivlake \- [The Difference Between “Significant” and “Not Significant” is not Itself Statistically Significant](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/signif4.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

* u/LilyTheBet \- Implementing a Bayesian A/B test might yield more transparent results and more practical in business decision making ([https://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-ab-testing.html](https://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-ab-testing.html))

&amp;#x200B;

* u/glauskies \- Practical significance vs statistical significance. A lot of companies look for practical significance. There are cases where you can reject the null but the alternate hypothesis does not lead to any real-world impact.

&amp;#x200B;

* u/dmlane \- I think the key thing the interviewer wanted to see is that you wouldn’t draw different conclusions from the two experiments.

&amp;#x200B;

* u/Cheaptat \- Possible follow-up questions: how expensive would the change this test is designed to measure be? Was the average impact positive for the business, even if questionably measurable? What would the potential drawback of implementing it be? They may well have wanted you to state some assumptions (reasonable ones, perhaps a few key archetypes) and explain what you’d have done.

&amp;#x200B;

* u/seesplease \- Assuming the null hypothesis is true, you have a 1/20 chance of getting a p-value below 0.05. If you test the same hypothesis twice and a p-value around 0.05 both times with an effect size in the same direction, you just witnessed a \~1/400 event assuming the null is true! Therefore, you should reject the null.

&amp;#x200B;

* u/robml  u/-lawnder  \-Bonferroni's Correction. Common practice to avoid data snooping is that you divide the alpha threshold by the number of tests you conduct. So say I conduct 5 tests with an alpha of 0.05, I would test for an individual alpha of 0.01 to try and curtail any random significance.You divide alpha by the number of tests you do. That's your new alpha.

&amp;#x200B;

* u/Coco_Dirichlet \- Note - If you calculate marginal effects/first differences, for some values of X there could be a significant effect on Y.

&amp;#x200B;

* u/spyke252 \- I think they were specifically trying to test knowledge of what p-hacking is in order to avoid it!

&amp;#x200B;

* u/dcfan105 \- an attempt to test if you'd recognize the problem with making a decision based on whether a single probability is below some arbitrary alpha value. Even if we assume that everything else in the study was solid - large sample size, potential confounding variables controlled for, etc., a p value *that* close the alpha value is clearly not very strong evidence, *especially* if a subsequent p value was just slightly above alpha.

&amp;#x200B;

* u/quantpsychguy \- if you ran the test once and got 0.049 and then again and got 0.051, I'm seeing that the data is changing. It might represent drift of the variables (or may just be due to incomplete data you're testing on).

&amp;#x200B;

* u/oldmangandalfstyle \- understanding to be that p-values are useless outside the context of the coefficient/difference. P-values asymptotically approach zero, so in large samples they are worthless. And also the difference between 0.049 and 0.051 is literally nothing meaningful to me outside the context of the effect size. It’s critical to understand that a p-value is strictly a conditional probability that the null is true given the observed relationship. So if it’s just a probability, and not a hard stop heuristic, how does that change your perspective of its utility?

&amp;#x200B;

* u/24BitEraMan \- It might also be that you are attributing a perfectly fine answer to them deciding not to hire you, when they already knew who they wanted to hire and were simply looking for anything to tell you no.

&amp;#x200B;

\-----

&amp;#x200B;

**Original Post:**

Long story short, after weeks of interviewing, made it to the final rounds, and got rejected because of this very basic question:

Interviewer: Given you run an A/B test and the alpha is .05 and you get a p-value = .01 what do you do (in regards to accepting/rejecting h0 )?

Me: I would reject the null hypothesis.

Interviewer: Ok... what if you run another test for another problem, alpha = .05 and you get a p-value = .04999 and subsequently you run it once more and get a p-value of .05001 ?

Me: If the first test resulted in a p-value of .04999 and the alpha is .05 I would again reject the null hypothesis. I'm not sure I would keep running tests unless I was not confident with the power analysis and or how the tests were being conducted.

Interviewer: What else could it be?

Me: I would really need to understand what went into the test, what is the goal, are we picking the proper variables to test, are we addressing possible confounders? Did we choose the appropriate risk (alpha/beta) , is our sample size large enough, did we sample correctly (simple,random,independent), was our test run long enough?

Anyways he was not satisfied with my answer and wasn't giving me any follow-up questions to maybe steer me into the answer he was looking for and basically ended it there.

I will add I don't have a background in stats so go easy on me, I thought my answers were more or less on the right track and for some reason he was really trying to throw red herrings at me and play ""gotchas"".

Would love to know if I completely missed something obvious, and it was completely valid to reject me. :) Trying to do better next time.

" Hi there, 

I am a medical student conducting some computer vision research and so forgive me if I am a bit off on the technical details. I am in a unique position where I currently have access to two machines: one with a 3080Ti and one with a 3090. I also happen to have an extra 3080Ti on hand.  
 

Currently, I am only performing the following tasks:  
 1.) inference using a CV model on a lot of video data

2.) Training basic NLP models

3.) Some sim racing (although this is obviously less of a hardware priority)

I understand enough (I think) to know that NVLink doesn’t actually matter that much unless you have a GPU cluster, and SLI doesn’t really work across different GPUs? I am basically at the crossroads of how to better parallelize across these 3 GPUs for an optimal setup. Lately I’ve been on the data parallelization route when it comes to inference by splitting my data across machines. I am wondering however, is it worth trading a 3080Ti up for a 3090 to build a dual 3090 NVLink system? Not sure if the model I am using can take advantage of parallelization, but even if it cannot, how often is model parallelization across multi-gpu’s easily accessible/possible?  
 

Additionally, are there any other advantages of this dual 3090 setup in other regards? For sim racing graphics, handling multi-monitors, data pre-processing, handling large datasets, etc….

This is all assuming that doing any other configuration outside of a dual 3090 NVLink setup is not worth it because of efficiency losses of mixing two different GPU’s (which I am also not sure how applicable this is). Also on the first machine with 3080Ti I have a X570 motherboard which I believe would only be able to run a second GPU at 8 PCIe lanes. (I’ve read that this doesn’t actually matter but am unclear about this).

Clearly, I need a little bit of guidance and am just hoping to have a somewhat clearer understanding before I go mess around with a bunch of hardware! Any resources, advice, thoughts would be much appreciated!

"As the title already describes I am interest in how you would approach a spatio-temporal forecasting problem.   
I am a data science student, currently doing a project where I want to use time and space features to predict demand.  
In detail: I would like to forecast demand such as taxi demand for a given location and time as for example described in the following [medium article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/new-york-yellow-taxi-demand-prediction-using-machine-learning-fc697d20ff86) using the New York-Taxi Dataset as example.  


I researched the topic a lot and found ton on information ranging from classical approaches which are pure statistical such as ARIMA to using simple and deep machine learning models. Also it seems like there has been a lot of improvement made in the last years since I found a lot of papers dealing with the NYC Taxi Demand Prediction using different models and techniques. The most recent I read were [this one (GSTNet: Global Spatial-Temporal Network for Traffic Flow Prediction)](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/gstnet-global-spatial-temporal-network-for) were they trying to predict the taxi demand using a GSTN model as well as [this one ( Deep Multi-View Spatial-Temporal Network for Taxi Demand Prediction)](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/deep-multi-view-spatial-temporal-network-for) were they combined a CNN for the spatial aspect of the problem and a LSTM for the time problem. Both papers describing the process and achieved stunning results.  


Moreover I found the [DARTS Library by Unit 8](https://github.com/unit8co/darts) which offers a nice tool case for time series problems, however they unfortunately don't seem to include and possibilities for covering space aspects, so using this I would need to train an independent model for each cluster and totally loose and space relations between them.  


My thoughts so far are, that I would first cluster my data based on departures being close to one another. Furthermore I would like to include point of interest data, such as if there are a lot of restaurants or a lot of housing in the given area.   
Moreover I though also on including this information also in my later model.  
So besides passing information only time related, I would like to include also information about the space cluster where the departures happened.  


To round it up, I would be really interested in how you would approach such a problem and how you would make sure that time related features such as weather and space related features such a number of restaurants in the cluster are caputred by your model.  
Would you use a stacking approach to do so, or just go for some fancy model that is able to do both?  


Also if you have any more articles or papers dealing with this, please share (even if I am confident I did my research the past two weeks).",Discussion: How would you approach a time series problem with spatial components (Spatio-Temporal Forecasting),datascience

"I'm working on a project where I'm doing data analysis on some client information through their database. They have Azure Data Studio and SSMS and I was wondering which would be more beneficial for my situation. I'm expecting it to be primarily analysis with very little admin-type work, but I did have to help with creating the data model with my senior, parsing the source data to fit the model, and work with the existing database team to integrate with their current system (not really sure if that counts lol). A lot of my team uses SSMS because it's what their used to but both apps are new. From initial impressions and what I've read online so far, it looks like ADS is more user-friendly and primarily an analysis tool with the IDE and features, while SSMS is more admin-focused but I'm not sure if I'm coming up to that conclusion through biases.

Prior to this I mainly used MySQL Workbench and in turn MySQL for college projects for general database learning, but I can't imagine there being a large leap of difference (feel free to tell me if I'm wrong). Other than that, I'm more experienced with Python and using different libraries to do basic queries to extract data.

"I am working on a project to classify some messages received from our customers. Basically I have to predict -in real time- the problem of those messages (hundreds of messages are received every day).

Our SAC team have already classified all the messages we have received but I noticed that there are many messages classified to the wrong category (i.e we cant trust the current labels).

That been said, my question is, What exactly should I do now to accomplish what I need ?

My initial plan is:

1. Do some basics text cleaning
2. Vectorizing the messages using Word2Vec
3. Creating some clusters using KMenas (here I plan to create a large number of clusters and then maybe merge some of them)
4. Giving names (categories) to those clusters based on most common words
5. Predict the new data using the pre-trained Kmeans classifier.

"I have a dataset of text-based documents that I want to cluster. For a sample of this dataset (~10%) I have manually annotated labels (i.e., the ground truth). I would like to cluster this dataset to ""automate"" the annotation of the remainder of dataset. The assumption is that I can not expend the resources to label the rest. I also can't build a classifier with the labeled data because the assumption is that it does not include all possible labels present in the remaining data. I see two options for this:

1. Cluster the entire dataset. Select the clustering algorithm, number of clusters, other parameters by maximizing an external cluster validation index (e.g., ARI) on the labeled sample, thus assuming if the produced clusters conform with the manual labels, the clusters for the unlabeled data should be similarly composed (similar idea of a cluster for this data). 

2. Cluster the labeled sample only. Select the algorithm and other methodological details by maximizing an external cluster validation index. Then, use that method for the entire dataset and select algorithm parameters, number of clusters using a mix of internal validation indices and qualitative review.

Does one of these methods pass the sniff test? I haven't seen this exact use case yet in literature but I'm sure it's out there, just can't seem to find it.

"From my 3-year experience in London fintech as a data scientist working with C-level executives, and from the self-learning journey leading up to that, I’ve created a template to learn the data science skills that companies are looking for.

It’s the template I wish I had when I started learning data science and applying for jobs. You can personalize it to fit your interests and career aspirations.

&amp;#x200B;

My own data science journey started four years ago. I was an unhappy electrical engineer in aerospace. I was looking for something less narrow and more challenging, so I self-learned everything I needed to know about data science. This was a long journey with many detours, but eventually I felt confident enough to start applying, and after a few months I was hired as a data scientist in a vibrant fintech startup in London.

It turned out real-world data science is quite different from what I had studied! I learned about databases, data cleaning, software engineering, but the most challenging was communicating my findings to business stakeholders - both verbally as well as with data visualizations that show a clear message. So I was anxious at first and learned slowly. Eventually I got the hang of it and worked for three years with very hands-on business data, providing real value to C-level decision makers.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a template to self-learn the DS skills companies are looking for, in less time than it took me.

The template is based around 3 pillars:

* Math &amp; Stats
* Software Engineering &amp; Tools
* Data &amp; Business Communication

The Math &amp; Stats section contains a structured list of recommended topics and principles to learn, with links to relevant resources like [Khan](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/modeling-distributions-of-data/normal-distributions-library/v/ck12-org-normal-distribution-problems-qualitative-sense-of-normal-distributions) [Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/confidence-intervals-one-sample/introduction-to-confidence-intervals/v/confidence-intervals-and-margin-of-error) [videos](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors-and-spaces/vectors/v/vector-introduction-linear-algebra) and the classic books like *Introduction to Statistical Learning*).

The Software Engineering &amp; Tools sections walks through tools to learn (based around the Jupyter-Python-Pandas ecosystem), and links to [tutorials](https://www.learnpython.org/), [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyhVh-qRZPA&amp;feature=emb_title), [example notebooks](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks/blob/master/pandas/03.03-Operations-in-Pandas.ipynb) and [cheat sheets](https://startupsventurecapital.com/essential-cheat-sheets-for-machine-learning-and-deep-learning-researchers-efb6a8ebd2e5) (all created by other fantastic people, I take no credit for the linked resources) to learn Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn and Matplotlib.

The Data &amp; Business Communication section is the real core of the template, where both of the previous sections come together. It’s shaped after the process for a typical business data science project:

* Data collection
* Data exploration
* Data cleaning &amp; preparation
* Machine learning modeling: here I mention some common models actually used in businesses, like linear+logistic regression, random forests and timeseries forecasting
* Model evaluation
* Reporting &amp; data visualization: focus on creating clear plots here
* Communicating with stakeholders: this is where I go more in depth on communicating your results to business decision makers, and telling a story which a layman can understand

The study content provided in the template is minimal, but you can go as in-depth as you like with the linked resources. The idea is that you study those resources by yourself, and then write down what you learned in your own words, directly into your own copy of the template.

And of course you can modify this template to your own taste. Delete what doesn’t interest you, and add more where you want to dive deeper.

&amp;#x200B;

I like to learn with flashcards (especially to memorize common interview questions), so I’ve added some example flashcards to help you get started - you can add your own flashcards or delete them if it isn’t for you.

&amp;#x200B;

Here’s the full template in Traverse (my app, with integrated flashcards):

[https://traverse.link/dominiczijlstra/zadn5zj1z3lyhf04ptok99u0](https://traverse.link/dominiczijlstra/zadn5zj1z3lyhf04ptok99u0)

Here is the same template in Notion (without the flashcards, you could use Anki in parallel):

[https://dominiczijlstra.notion.site/Data-Science-Roadmap-82739cbad35c409595876263cacde0e4](https://dominiczijlstra.notion.site/Data-Science-Roadmap-82739cbad35c409595876263cacde0e4)

I intend to do it in a multithreaded fashion because otherwise it will take too long. However, with foreign keys and such this will cause issues with race conditions. For instance authors in these repositories can be repeated and depending on who comes across an author first, several threads may erroneously attempt to insert at the same time causing errors in the process. I could just insert the data for the authors and repositories first but this is just going to be way too slow for 25000 repositories and it cannot be done in a multithreaded fashion.

"Full transparency here: my exposure to data science has been by trade, not by formal education or training. That comes with knowledge/terminology gaps, so I apologize in advance for those. If something isn't clicking with you, please feel free to ask clarifying questions and I'll do my best to answer them.

I had an idea for a visualization I wanted to see if there was something out there that does this already in python, or even more fundamentally if there are oversights in my thinking that would blow up this kind of approach from the get-go.

clustering basics: k-centroid clustering starts by selecting k random points and evaluating 'distances' from those k points across the remainder of the dataset. Each data point is then assigned to a 'cluster' based on which of these k points it is closest to.

The problem: those k points are assigned randomly. And we usually get around this by running a clustering exercise repeatedly. But since every single point gets assigned to a cluster, we can end up with points that are 'promiscuous' and end up in different clusters a lot. And I haven't found a good way of visually describing this.

The summary of the proposition: a kind of topographical map, where we first identify k points that are (basically) never in the same cluster. Then we track how frequently each of the various data points are in the same cluster as each of those k points. So if K1 and point 56,757 are in the same cluster 95% of the time, that pairing has a height of 0.95. And if K2 and point 5,251 are in the same cluster 50% of the time, that pairing has a height of 0.5.

So then we take the set of K that are most exclusive to each other, make a pair of orthogonal eigenvectors out of them and pretend that these are new axes. Then we plot the full dataset onto these new axes and then treat the frequency of how often those points are paired together as the 'height' of the relationship.

Then, I think, we have a topographical map. Setting a threshold of how frequently point-to-centroid pairs share a cluster is essentially like setting the sea level of this topographical map, and there's probably some curve that identifies how much information we lose for each 0.01 of the 'sea level' and then we can probably fit some half-dozen different kinds of optimization algorithms there to find out the 'ideal' height.

The resulting ""islands"" are your new, improved, and focused clusters, with 'promiscuous' data points underwater.",Cluster Stability visualization technique,datascience

"I've been in the ""data"" field for few years after previously training in a clinical area but never quite got the ""data scientist"" title-have been working as a statistician, then an analyst and really became advanced in my coding/programming skills over the course of the last few years. I realize I enjoy programming and could envision coding all day. My most recent job ended up being less analysis and modeling and more 'using code so I never have to do manual work again'-some of it sucked b/c but it was also rewarding to figure out how to write scripts for stuff people were doing manually for years.

However, I a pretty common theme I honestly felt in my last few jobs is that I quickly lost sight as to what I was doing because the people overseeing the projects seemed to have a lack of clear goals in their work. My work was basically centered around ad-hoc requests from people-sometimes unrealistic requests, it became repetitive and boring and everything felt like we were just doing things for the sake of doing them. 

I started applying to jobs both in my original field and data science roles in tech with the hopes I can do a job where at minimum I know what I'm supposed to be doing everyday and ended up getting got an offer at a place I originally applied for in a clinical role but ended up in a bit of a random role where I am neither doing data science (b/c they already have a team of pretty talented people who are coding, creating dashboards and modeling) or clinical work-I'm basically an in between person coming up with 'new ideas' and measures-it's really up to me to define the role. The thing is there are some clinical people who know what they are looking for when it comes to data, so it's basically right now a pipeline between them and the data team and I don't know where I fit in the puzzle. The people I work with so far are great and I do think it's nice to have the freedom of trying something new, but I feel very limited-I don't have access to the data which the data team does and they probably won't prioritize me getting access since I'm not on that team. I've been coming up with projects that aren't dashboards, but I sort of feel like I'm getting that 'doing for the sake of doing' feeling. 

I'm assuming (from some posts here) some of you have felt this way-any tips to navigate? I'm allocating some time to self-teaching and doing side projects so I still feel like I can be a part of the data world, but funnily I feel overwhelmed from being a bit underwhelmed and could use some insight how to better navigate that.

"I’m in a undergraduate Bayesian statistics course. Thus far we have learned three cases of conjugate Bayesian models:

Beta binomial, normal normal, gamma poisson.

I’m wondering how often these specific cases, or in other words, conjugate Bayesian models are easy to apply in practice. As in, with knowledge equipped from these three conjugate models, can I solve a wide variety of problems? Or in practice is it more about specifying custom likelihoods and mixing and matching priors and likelihoods to get what I want? 

Is just knowing these three models well enough to be dangerous with using Bayesian methods in practice? What more would I need to know?",How often can you use “off the self” Bayesian models in application/practice?,datascience

"Hi all! I've been talking to many folks lately about dealing with code quality in Jupyter notebooks, and I'd like to hear the perspective of the r/datascience community. To get started, here are a few things I've heard:

1. **Allow Jupyter notebooks but refactor them before deployment.** This is the most common answer, people are allowed to use notebooks but before deployment, there is a big refactoring process where the notebook is converted into scripts or functions. One problem I see with this approach is that it's slow and error-prone, sometimes results from the original notebook cannot be reproduced.
2. **Deploy notebooks as-is.** This is an interesting approach, teams execute notebooks in production. I think it works ok for simple projects (e.g. notebooks with &lt; 100 cells) but it gets difficult to maintain for larger projects.
3. **Ban the use of Jupyter notebooks.** Pretty strict IMO, what ends up happening is that a lot of code lives outside the git repository and gets lost there. This approach forces Jupyter users to refactor their code before merging it into the codebase.
4. **Use jupytext and write small notebooks.** This is a pretty rare answer (because many people don't know about jupytext yet). but I think it's a great solution: jupytext essentially allows you to open .py files as notebooks so can edit the code in Jupyter but version it with git without issues. The main caveat here is that although it enables code reviews, it doesn't fully solve the problem, and the notebooks/scripts may still have some hidden state.

I'm currently doing my undergrad dissertation, which requires a lot of data analysis, but from an econometric perspective - regressions, significance testing, unit root testing, serial correlation testing, heteroskedasticity, looking at the distribution of the residuals e.t.c.

"Working in medical field, we regularly see datasets that contain variables with coded values. For example like this:

    Biopsy visit (standardmatvisit)  
    0 = No  
    1 = Yes
    
    Number biopsies for research, max. 3 (standardmatsamples)
    1 = 1
    2 = 2
    3 = 3

Sure, makes sense to me, that second one could be a numeric value with min/max but ok. However, then I see things like this:

    Performance status (perfstat)  
    1 = 0  
    2 = 1  
    3 = 2  
    4 = 3  
    5 = 4  
    6 = 5
