"Hey everyone,

I've been wondering if there's a way to dynamically share types between programming languages, almost like how Prisma allows you to change the schema locally and update a central database that can be picked up by a different application.

Specifically, I'm wondering if there's a tool or framework out there that would allow me to define my types in one language (e.g. TypeScript) and have those types automatically generated in another language (e.g. Python) without needing to manually write out the same types in both languages.

Does anyone know of anything like this? Or am I just dreaming up something that doesn't exist?

"Hey! I'm a product owner looking for some advice about RBAC: CRUD vs read/write permissions.

Context: large scale, multitenant platform with a buttload of permissions and deals with a lot of regulations / sensitive data.

We're designing our authorization system and I'm going back and forth with tech leadership. There are two options we're between. Example for each option where the object being given permissions to manage is a ""product"":

Product: read/write
Delete product: read/write
If role has product - r/w they can read, create, update a product
If role has delete product - r/w they can see delete button and delete a product

OR

Product: create, read, update, delete
If role has product - create they can create a product
If role has product - delete they can delete a product

"We have a scenario at work. We use OIDC and Google OAUTH to enable users sign in with their google account. The initial scopes on the access token are limited. Along the line in the app flow, if users want to create meetings with other users, we ask users to add new scopes to their access token with an ""add your google calendar"" button, we then store the user's calendar ID in the backend &amp; the access token (which we store on the frontend) has updated scopes to interact with the google calendar API. Now, if a user signs out, we delete these tokens from the frontend. But if a user re logs in, the ""Add google calendar"" button will not be displayed because on our Frontend, we check to see if a calendar is associated with the user in the db and since the user has added their calendar before, the button doesnt show. The issue is, the access token now doesnt have the calendar scope on it since it is a new login and hence the meeting creation fails due to ""insufficient scope"", how best can I handle this situation?",Google authentication handling.,SoftwareEngineering

"Hi Folks, 

I’m a software engineer with just under 7 years experience in industry. I primarily develop backend systems in Java / Kotlin, primarily for container based usage in the cloud. Most of the systems I design are event based, so lots of times I stand up Kafka and other messaging systems via docker for local development. I also have an interest in mobile development, primarily in Kotlin Native at the moment, but I’d like to look at alternatives. However the mobile work is purely personal L&amp;D.

I have a MacBook Pro that I have through work, but there’s no option to use that for my own local development needs, nor would I really want to perform local / side project work on that machine, or even have the right to do so. I’ve had a chunk of time away from doing personal development and side projects, and I want to kick start that again therefore this prompted me to seek some advise. 

I’m an avid PC gamer and have quite a hefty Windows based rig that I have had some success using WSL for a local development environment, however since upgrading to Windows 11, I’ve really struggled to get it to work. It’s become almost unusable due to my IDE (IntelliJ) crashing when trying to select JDK’s in WSL, and I’ve been thinking about recently whether to buy another dedicated machine, or for instance dual boot my Windows machine? (Haven’t done this for a looong time)

I’ve been eyeing up potentially shelling out for a Mac Mini as a home development machine, as a cheap (ish) way to get into the mac eco system, maybe open up looking at iOS specific application development. Plus then its decoupled from my Windows machine. However my Windows machine is a very powerful machine, with good cooling and performance over all.  I’d be more than happy even with an Ubuntu based build.

For those in the community, what local dev setups do you have? Is the Mac Mini a viable option? Should I completely purge and reinstall WSL and continue with that route? Or should I just dual boot my machine?",Personal Development Machine Setup advice / question / recommendation,SoftwareEngineering

In our new product, we are adding support for leaving comments via formatted rich text editors in our product. We have implemented the frontend side (using React + TipTap/Prose-mirror) and are continuing to build out the persistance layer.

Our options are:

1. Save the generated HTML.
2. Save the content data in JSON format.
3. Save in a custom format provided by our tool of choice.

All three options have benefits and downsides. For example, HTML is very direct because it will be the data that we will display back to the users, but it lacks easy to parse information like user mentions, and it is hard to adjust the style later down the road. JSON contains all the data in a nice and parsable format, but we will need extra effort to convert back and forth between representations.

"*This is part request for advice, but also part venting. Feel free to ignore if I lean too much on the latter.

What strategies can I use to deal with work that does not engage me or even de-motivates me?

My team changed its tech stack completely about a year ago. We went from writing in a functional paradigm, which took me years to get comfortable with (though now I LOVE it) to focusing on OOP and integrating off-the-shelf solutions in an OOP language.

Development work no longer engages me. Everything I write I’m just frustrated that I don’t have the syntax features or safety I had when writing in our previous language. But my boss says it’s supposed to be good for my career growth because our new tech stack is an industry standard so I’ll be more experienced in what companies are looking for. But I am just no longer happy or feeling engaged.

The last few months there’s been a huge push to write unit tests for every component and every layer. Every time I get one of these unit test tickets it takes me far longer to complete than the actual development. We have to mock so many components, mock so much data, and the entire time I just want to throw my laptop at a wall. 

It’s not that the testing is too difficult, I just don’t find it engaging. We have nested data structures and the syntax of this language is more verbose than my previous languages (scripting + functional) and I feel like I’m much slower at getting anything done even though I can work out what needs to be done in my head fairly quickly.

Honestly I feel like I’m acting like a spoiled child. I don’t see other developers throwing a fit. They are not fans of the change but they’re getting their work done all the same. Meanwhile I’m falling behind and my performance is starting to get affected. Every time I get assigned a testing ticket it takes even longer than it took me to develop the feature.

I realize no matter what team I move to, testing is always a part of development. But at least with our old tech stack testing felt like it’s own unique challenge, and I could write the tests as quickly as I could think them up.

I can’t tell if my problem is that I’m in the wrong place - like I just need to move to a team with a language/stack I enjoy - or if it’s that I have a bad mindset. Every job has its good parts and its bad parts. And I feel like I’m pretty bad at dealing with the bad parts. I feel like objectively if I get my work done like everyone else on the team my career is sure to grow. But I am just hating doing my job.

I was faced with a similar issue in my previous job. I wrote a lot in a scripting language and got great at it, but then we had to switch to a DSL for most of our workflow. That DSL felt like it was handicapping me and stunting my growth, and after a year I got fed up and left for a new job.

I’ve only had two jobs but given the similar experience in both, I’m worried that this cycle will repeat itself. I’m wondering if I just need to change my mindset rather than continuing to leave for new positions.

I’m also wondering if maybe I’m just not a good fit for the industry. I absolutely loved college and the intellectual challenge that came with learning new things constantly. I’m wondering if academia would let me pursue these challenges non-stop and whether I should consider doing a graduate program.

Would appreciate any advice. Even telling me I’m acting like kid and need to grow up would be helpful, because then I know it’s just a common experience and I’m not uniquely bad for software work, just need to overcome personal hurdles.",Problems with de-motivation,SoftwareEngineering

"So before this team was formed, I was already working on the project with people from US for like last 7 months or something. Then the project manager tells me he only has slot for the project for me once he got contract with customer. So basically I was put into a team with all people in India since December. They needed me because basically the project was finished and I knew the project inside out since I did majority of it.

Anyway, originally he says it would be about 3 months and I have meetings with the 8:30pm everyday but since there’s daylight savings I have meetings 9:30pm everyday. I was ok with this at first but I found that I was not getting the same treatment. For example, their engineers get to share their screen, and openly discuss but when it’s my turn they never ask me to screenshare and the manager said yesterday the case is different for me, I need to send everything over email. I get that it’s faster for them to receive updates over email but I never have anyone to go to for help or discuss things technically. I’m starting to see that I do most of the hard work that none of them knows how to do and I have to teach them everything when they’re senior developers and I am a JUNIOR. Also he never seems to understand what I am saying and it’s frustrating. Regardless, my time with him should’ve ended but he keeps extending it because their engineers couldn’t not replace me yet.

So I wanted to ask is it ok for me to ask to stop attending those meetings and just send my updates over email? Idk why he wants me to attend. I’m tired of it when I hear him rambling every night. Also can I ask to stop with the project after this one end because it’s difficult for me to do that every night?

This is my first developing job so idk if I can do this. Please give some input.","In my project all of the members are from India, only I am from US. I am starting to hate it, please give some advice.",SoftwareEngineering

"I've seen many, many schedules over the years, but almost no hard numbers about how the reality matched up to the plan. I suspect there are two main reasons for this:

1. Management is embarrassed,
2. The requirements changed over time, so it's not possible to compare what was planned to what actually got done.

I think #2 is bogus. Requirements *always* change. If you remodel your house, you always end up doing more or less than the contractor's estimate. That's not an aberration; that's normal.

Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman writes about this in a chapter of *Thinking Fast and Slow* (""The Planning Delusion""). It's not unique to software. Everyone wants to think their project is unique and there is nothing to be learned from history.

"We often talk about inheritance being overused. Often, we give out ""composition"" as the medicine to cure us from this inheritance-overuse disease. Over time, I've realized that composition, by itself, only helps to replace just one aspect of inheritance. Inheritance is a large subject and there's many reasons people reach for it.

So, I put together [this article](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/composition-alone-cant-replace-inheritance-606760f03d60?source=friends_link&amp;sk=24f58b20b2d4162404376c6f7ec16301) that tries to lay out a bunch of different patterns that can be used in place of inheritance. I've never seen a comprehensive article like this before, and it's the type of article I wish the earlier me had, when I would use inheritance in places where, sure, it worked, but there were definitely better ways to approach the problem that I just wasn't thinking of.

So, my question for the community:
* When do you feel it is appropriate to use inheritance?
* Are there times you've used inheritance in the past, and since then you've also learned of better ways to solve the same problem?
* Are there times you've used inheritance in the past, and you feel that none of the suggestions from the article would have worked well to replace your use of it?
* General feedback on the article is welcome as well, though I'm also cool if you just want to answer these discussion questions after a minimal skim, or without reading it at all (It's a long article).",When do you like to use inheritance?,SoftwareEngineering

I enjoy exploring Kubernetes internals and tackling issues related to distributed systems and scalability.

In addition, I have a background in robotics, having worked for an autonomous vehicles company for three years. I also have \~2 years experience in machine learning, mainly theoretical but with a couple small projects under my belt. I am particularly passionate about everything related to ML/AI, and the recent progress in large language models has obviously piqued my interest even more.

I'm curious if there are any existing or upcoming challenges, or even subfields, at the intersection of these two domains (ML/AI and distributed systems/scalability).

Should I get it? I don't know anything about Macbooks, *Macbook* specs, or how much one costs, but I assume this is a great price, at least from what I could figure from a quick google.

"I recently graduated from university. Now, I am working for a small startup. I like the full-stack aspect of it, as you get in touch with various technologies. Another thing I like is the responsibility you have, and the fact that you see the ""work"" you do. However, I do not share the same philosophy as my co-workers and boss. For them, it is more important to deliver code quickly. The quality (code, architecture, performance, ...) is secondary. Although this works in smaller teams, I feel that it does not allow me to grow as a software engineer. While I get in contact with a lot of different technologies, I only get to have a very surface-level understanding of their concepts (for example ORM, TDD, Docker, ...).

"Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process that aims to ensure the quality of the software by running a set of test cases more frequently. This is the opposite of creating the software and then the tests which the software will be tested against.

Usually, the steps you follow on TDD are the following:

1. Add a new test:

* This test should pass **if, and only** **if,** all the specifications defined in the feature are met.
* Focus on the requirements before coding.

2. Run all tests:

* The new test should fail.
* Because it fails, it shows that new code is needed for the new feature.
* This will also validate that the testing mechanism is working correctly and that the new test is not flawed in a way that will always pass.

3. Implement the feature:

* The code you write should be the simplest one that ensures the new test passes.

4. Run all tests:

* All tests should pass.
* If they don't, the code should be revisited, and changes will be made until the tests pass.

5. Refactor as needed:

* Go back and improve the code if needed.
* Rely on the tests to ensure everything works fine after the refactoring.

I wrote about an educational example to show the basics of TDD using Data Structures, you can read about it here: [A Tale of Testing: The Basics of Test-Driven Development with a Focus on Data Structures](https://albexl.hashnode.dev/a-tale-of-testing-the-basics-of-test-driven-development-with-a-focus-on-data-structures)

"Hey everyone!

I wanted to share my atypical journey of transitioning from IT Support to Software Engineering. I don't often come across stories of people taking this path, so I figured it's high time I shared my experience and answer any questions you might have. What makes my story unusual is that I have no degree, no formal training, and no Bootcamp experience.

**2016: Humble Beginnings**

My journey began in 2016 as an IT Support technician at a bank, earning a mere $12.55/hour. Trying to support my family on this salary was a struggle. I knew I had to make a change, so in 2018, I obtained my CDL and ventured into the oil field. This move tripled my income to $36/hour, allowing me to pay bills and save up for a future move to a bigger city with better IT job opportunities.

**2018: The Oil Field Nightmare**

I loathed every second of my time in the oil field. The working conditions were abysmal—115-hour weeks, 18-32 hour shifts with no breaks, 24/7 on-call, and no scheduled days off. Weather was no friend either, with temperatures ranging from -30 to 100 degrees. I wouldn't recommend this experience to my worst enemy.

**2020: A New Beginning**

By 2020, I had saved enough to pay off all my debts, allowing me to quit the oil field, move to the big city, and survive on a lower salary. I landed a temp job at a large corporation, working in Desktop Support for a 3-month contract at $16/hour. While it didn't pay the bills entirely, my debt-free life made the hit to my savings more manageable.

**2020: Apple Support and the School District**

As my contract ended, I received a job offer from a school district as an Apple Support tech, earning $18/hour. This job barely covered the bills, but it was a ton of work. I was the sole technician for the entire district, managing iPads, Macs, and support tickets.

**2021: Stepping up as Desktop Technician**

In 2021, I was offered a position as a Desktop Technician for the county, which paid $24/hour. Initially, the workload was manageable, and I had some extra money to invest. However, two months in, my situation changed as I had to commute to five different offices with only 31 cents/mile in reimbursement.

When the Intune specialist resigned, I inherited their responsibilities, now juggling device management, scripting, packaging, and support tickets for the entire county.

**2022: Turning the Tide with SwiftUI**

By the third quarter of 2022, I was fed up with my stagnant pay and ever-increasing workload. Desperate for a change, I dove into software development, specifically iOS development. I committed to Paul Hudson's 100 Days of SwiftUI, completing the challenge in December 2022. I began a personal project (a habit-tracking app) and started applying for jobs.

**2023: Breakthrough at Last!**

Two months and 180 applications later, I finally landed my first interview. A medical company needed an iOS developer to transition their app from Flutter to native development. I aced both interviews and was offered the position at a whopping $55/hour! The job is a hybrid, requiring me to be in the office only on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

This change has been transformative for me. I've left the mundane world of basic support tickets behind and now play a crucial role in developing software that improves people's lives. My journey from IT Support to Software Engineering may have been unconventional, but it's a testament to the power of perseverance and self-motivation.

**Conclusion: Embracing the Unconventional Path**

My story is a reminder that it's never too late to pivot your career and chase your dreams. While the road to success may not be a straight line, embracing the challenges and staying determined can open doors you never thought possible. I hope my experience inspires others in IT Support roles to explore the exciting world of software engineering and find their own paths to success.

If you have any questions or want to know more about my journey, please feel free to ask. I'm happy to share any insights I've gained along the way.

"Hello, I'm trying to compile a list of reasons why unnecessary side effects are undesirable in the long term.

There are some nice resources out there, for example, [this awesome thread](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/15269/why-are-side-effects-considered-evil-in-functional-programming) or Eric Elliot's post about [simplicity and side effects](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-single-biggest-mistake-programmers-make-every-day-62366b432308). Then there are more specific good posts about Python [import-time side effects](https://chrismorgan.info/blog/say-no-to-import-side-effects-in-python/) and the generic observation that side effects lead to [mocking in tests](https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/you-dont-hate-mocks-you-hate-side-effects). The majority of side-effect-related posts discuss it in the context of functional programming ([this one](https://thejs.dev/jmitchell/what-are-side-effects-and-what-you-can-do-about-them-jws), another [very good one from Jesse Warden](https://jessewarden.com/books/real-world-functional-programming/part1/01_input_output_side_effects.html), [one more](https://www.yld.io/blog/the-not-so-scary-guide-to-functional-programming/)).

But I just wanted to make a short list that you can pull out when needed. So here we go:

Code with side effects

* is fragile - unnecessary side effects lead to unexpected crashes because they deal with the external world.
* is typically slow - code lines with side effects are slower than ""normal"" code.
* is hard to optimize - a compiler or a developer has fewer degrees of freedom when optimizing a function with side effects.
* is hard to use concurrently - side effects mutate state and would clash in a concurrent environment.
* is hard to read and understand - it is hard to follow the logic that influences the external world and mutates the external state.
* is hard to reuse - developers would be reluctant to reuse code that does too many things (as opposed to a single return statement).
* is hard to debug, release and write tests - because of external dependencies, it is hard to write good tests which leads to longer/fragile releases

I'm mainly a Python/C++ developer, but looking online, I'm pretty sure those reasons apply to other non-FP languages like JavaScript or Java. I put more detailed arguments into [a blogpost](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/all-dangers-of-side-effects-for-python-coders-fdf0743457a3) on each of those items, and I'm looking for more. Does anyone have more resources on side effects which could be read by a junior dev without FP background?

P.S. Again, here I'm talking about **unnecessary** side effects: every software must have some side effects to be useful.",List of reasons to avoid unnecessary side effects,SoftwareEngineering
"I don't know if this is the right place to ask but I thought if anyone would know it would be the people here.

I've been dating my boyfriend for over a year and I know he's a software architect for a company who works from home but don't really know what that means or what it entails.  But I want to buy him something to make his life easier at work that will genuinely help him.

Is there something that a person in this career would be happy to get or is this the kind of thing I need to ask subtle questions about because it varies so much from person to person? 

I like giving him presents to show I care but I feel like all the presents I give him are pretty useless and sentimental and I want to get him something that really adds value to his life.

"String libraries exist to reduce boilerplate. We don't want to write `for i = 10 to 15; array.add(s[i]); next` when we could write `substring(s, 10, 6)`.

I have written an extensive string library to clear up any clutter related to the processing of strings. A focus of the library is on the elimination of ""magic arithmetic,"" i.e., expressions such as `last - first + 1`, which leave unexplained their exact purpose. My hope is that it will increase comprehension and eliminate off-by-one errors and other products of string-madness. The library is rather large, and leads me to wonder what has already been done in the field.

Crucial to the library is what we should name the functions. Christopher J. Date warned us to observe the ""Great Logical Differences."" We want to know exactly when an index function is zero-based or one-based, when a range function includes or excludes the upper-bound, and when a search function returns 0 or -1 when it fails. Not doing so may risk catastrophe.

Accordingly, it may be argued that string functions should be given precise names to distinguish their use. One of my functions is named `OneBasedLineNumberAt`. I included the modifier `OneBased` so anyone would know what output to expect. Another issue is parameter order. Requiring a name to indicate parameter order reduces the chance of reversing the arguments by mistake. Instead of `Join`, then, one may write `JoinArrayWithDelimiter`. The order of the parameters is determined by their order in the name. Thus, we may expect the function to first accept the array and then the delimiter.

Here are the string functions I've created so far. The names are not perfect. The preponderance of 'Move' and 'Seek' functions is to prevent off-by-one errors. Note that some of these can be generalized to arbitrary collections of items other than characters in a string:

However, creating a virtualization software solution that is efficient and reliable requires advanced programming knowledge and experience.

To create a program that shares hardware resources over a network, the software would need to be able to detect and allocate resources on the host computer, such as the GPU, CPU, and RAM, and allow remote access to these resources over a network. The program would also need to handle input/output between the host and remote client devices, and optimize performance to minimize latency and input lag.

Programming such a software requires knowledge of operating systems, networking, and virtualization technologies, as well as low-level programming languages like C/C++. It would also require extensive testing and optimization to ensure that the program is stable and performs well.

"I've been with a company in a junior position for 6 months now. It's a start up that consists of 2 developers, one being my lead, and the other myself. There is another person who can do some scripting, but mainly does client relations. Altogether there are 5 people in the company.    


My job from the start was to basically take tasks as they were assigned to me. Some would be bugs, others would be frontend implementations of a given service (think a library system). It would consist of me generating stuff for the other developer to have an easier time doing the backend, then I would use their backend functions to make my frontend work.   


Anyway, I found that no matter the task I was given, I would need help. Primarily regarding the code. One thing is reading the code, but there are so many nuances with the business that although I can read it, I don't understand why certain things are necessary. Nothing is commented, also. So typically, my lead would need to explain the system to me (we lack documentation there too) and I'd go off an implement what I could based on that. If I was given a bug, the same process happened. I could sometimes track it down, but then have no understanding of the big picture of what the code was trying to achieve, that I couldn't actually fix it.  


I should mention that this is work from home and 90% of my day I am by myself, the other 10% I am talking to my lead in discord.  


The problem I have is there's so much information to retain, and I'm never giving a full picture as my lead ""doesn't want to overwhelm me"" - which is fair. But, I struggle to remember things if I don't have dots to connect them to. My lead will get frustrated when I don't remember things - I write things down, but I don't remember the relationship between data tables we used 2 months ago and need a refresher.  


On top of that. The lead has a very particular way they like things to be done, but they refuse to micro manage. Typically, this results in me putting up a PR and they just go in and change it anyway. Sometimes to the point where all my code is changed and it was just a waste of time for me to do it. Note, that they tell me to keep things as simple as possible and not to make coding decisions based on anticipation of possibilities in the future.  


Other problems are poor management. Nobody knows who's doing what tasks. I've tried implementing labels and project tables in github, but no one seems to take to them. So, what ends up happening is I start on a task ""assigned to me"" or usually not (but it is easy), that the lead is already doing. Sometimes I'll start on a task and have assigned myself to it, and the lead does it.  


Now, the lead is away for months. They'll be doing around 10 hours a week. But will be away completely for the next month. They've left a bit unfinished, so I can't use certain areas of the codebase. I have no one other than the boss assigning me tasks, but he doesn't know my capabilities. I have no one to ask code related questions and the business is very hands off, so I mainly have to find my own work.

"# Background

I am on a team that develops many internal tools (Line of Business apps) to support business operations. We have around 50 independent web applications with varying levels of complexity, business logic, and integrations with both internal and external APIs. Not all applications use the exact same technology. The reason there are so many apps is because of the different business domains and the purposes that they serve.

# The Problem

Due to so many different sites, users have to ""know"" where to go to in order to ""find their thing"". Since it is web based, you can bookmark all the stuff you want. But this makes it difficult for new users  to learn where to go to find X business function. In addition, we must maintain each app with its framework and packages, so upgrading them all is tedious.

We are looking to add ""more"", but hesitant to spin up more web apps to fit different business needs.

It would be great from a user experience if everything could be access from the same UI and URL paths, for instance: ""[operations.company.com/finance](https://operations.company.com/finance)"" and ""[operations.company.com/shipping](https://operations.company.com/shipping)"" favored over ""[finance.company.com](https://finance.company.com)"" and ""[shipping.company.com](https://shipping.company.com)"".

# How to Implement?

The look and feel between different ""modules"" should generally be the same. However, I am unsure how to actually implement this in practice because we have several large code bases with their own UI's and API's.

Actually implementing something like this is where I get tripped up:

1. How do you prevent all code from being in one repository?
2. Does all UI code have to live inside the UI project, and then do you integrate with all backend APIs?
3. How to scale as more functionality is added?
4. Are there other strategies for accomplishing a **unified user experience**?

I've seen ""Micro front ends"" thrown around as a buzzword, but I'm seeing mostly negative experiences regarding that. Perhaps it is something to try, but I don't fully understand it and if it is worth the investment.

*&lt;side thought&gt;* I always have wondered how large web apps manage their deployments and code (example: Azure DevOps and all its modules). Is it just one big UI and monolith repo and one pipeline deployment to rule them all? If not, how is this actually accomplished? *&lt;/end side thought&gt;*

**Does anyone have advice for a strategy to adopt to solve this problem?** Thank you for any suggestions in advance!",Strategy for consolidating many Line of Business web apps under one UI,SoftwareEngineering

"I’ll give an actual scenario we can kick around implementation ideas with. My org needs a more powerful version of Active Directory (AD). I’ll call it “AD2” for short. Many apps need employee info and their position in the organization, including who their supervisor is. There are too many needs and requests for AD to deal with. (Maybe AD can be tweaked for more features &amp; power, but let’s put that aside for now.)

So one plan is to use our primary database brand, MS-SQL-Server (“MS-SQL” for short), to make a database with all the needed employee and org info: “AD2”. A selected group of people would be in charge of maintaining the content. (At this point it does not need a dedicated programmer(s) after initial release, just as-needed maintenance.)

Since MS-SQL is already used by most our apps, it’s easier to just query that info from it. We don’t initially need a JSON web interface. In the future some app or service may eventually need a web interface; and there are plugins for MS-SQL that allow Stored Procedure/View calls to accept and emit JSON services with little or no programming. If that’s not good enough, then we could make a mini-intranet-app to emit and receive JSON for the sub-set needed by these special apps.

So we have 3 levels of K.I.S.S. here for AD2:

1. Use the shop RDBMS to share needed info/queries.
2. Use plugins that convert already-written Stored Procedure/View I/O to web services.
3. Write a web-app wrapper around the Stored Procedures/Views, probably only for specific needs rather than wrap them all.

In our org, a medium-sized org, it would be foolish to start with #3 first. We can later get JSON-over-http if necessary, without starting from scratch. 

Further, if AD2 needs info from other databases, it’s relatively easy to make cross-database links/connections on the DB server(s) itself without coding a communication service, since it’s the same DB brand. Making a DB-vendor-neutral wrapper (JSON calls) is overkill as the default.

Some microservice proponents say #1 is already “microservices” but many don’t because it’s not “vendor neutral”.

If an org didn’t have a standard RDBMS (DB potpourri), then maybe JSON-first would be more rational. But I recommend that small and medium orgs settle on a primary RBDMS brand because it makes many things simpler, not just service sharing. 

For really big orgs, that may not be feasible; I don’t have enough experience in enough big orgs to comment. But I’ve worked in many small and medium orgs as both an employee and contractor, and this includes public and private. DB-first for inter-app info sharing is by far usually better.","Try RDBMS first, NOT microservices (at least for non-giant orgs)",SoftwareEngineering

" I'm  trying to understand how to solve the problem of pattern matching in a  stream of objects that represent events. Each object has keys and  values. For example {name: ""John Doe"", ""location"": ""latt: 40, long: 50"",  ...}. The pattern I want to match is for example an object with  name=""John Doe"" followed within 5 seconds by an object with name=""Jane  Doe"".

This can be solved using  finite automata. There needs to be a transition to the reset state, and a  transition to matching Joe Done, and a transition to match also Jane  Doe.

When programming this in  Java, one approach is to use int state, then add some if/else conditions  to change the state depending on whether the input event has the  expected name, and so on.

I  don't want to use a 3rd party software which compiles some made up  language into automata. I want to design and implement automata myself  to have a full control over what it is doing, and to make it easier to  debug and test.

2. Can  you advise on a method to specify requirements, design, construct, and  test an automata-based application for pattern matching in a stream of  objects?

"In software engineering, it seems to be standard practice to just give a task to a new employee and say “you figure it out.” There’s no training, no help, no collaboration. The new employee has to work independently and teach himself. And use google. Why? 

For example, I’ve been at my current job for about 2.5 months, and I’m being asked to make a significant change to the Spending Summary App. I’m not familiar with the Spending Summary App. Other developers wrote the app before I joined the company, probably over the course of many years. It’s over 5000 lines of code. It uses external libraries. It uses Maven, Lombok, Spring Boot, AOP, and probably some other frameworks that I’m not aware of.

I’m also being asked to use Grafana to make a panel that displays an app’s error rate, success rate, pool, and other data. I’ve never used Grafana before. From what I’ve gathered, Grafana uses Lucene, Gaia, and Elasticsearch. I’m not familiar with these things. No one is helping me. 

Wouldn’t it make sense to pair me up with a more experienced engineer, and for us to work together on this task, and for me to learn from them?

To explain how I feel, here are some analogies:

1. A student enrolls in Calculus 1. On the first day of class, the teacher hands him a final exam from Calculus 3, and says “figure it out” and then walks away.

2. You want to learn how to play the saxophone, and you’ve never played before. You get in touch with a musician who’s been playing the saxophone for 10 years. The musician hands you a saxophone and says “start playing” and then walks away.

3. You’ve never flown a helicopter before. You meet an experienced helicopter pilot. He shows you a helicopter, puts you in the pilot’s seat, and says, “please fly the helicopter,” and then he walks away. Then, he comes back to you, one week later, and yells at you and says “why haven’t you flown the helicopter yet?!”

I think we can all agree that these three examples are ridiculous. This would not result in a good knowledge of calculus, or a good saxophone player, or a good helicopter pilot.

So, why is this so common in software engineering? I’ve had two software engineering jobs within the past three years, at two different companies, and I was treated like this at both jobs. It seems to be a standard practice in the software industry. Why?

One explanation I’ve heard is, “the other programmers are busy with their own tasks, so they don’t have time to work with you and train you.” To continue the analogy, imagine you’ve never flown a helicopter before, and your boss says, “The other pilot has to fly to Baltimore, so he’s not going to train you. So please teach yourself how to fly a helicopter and fly yourself to Philadelphia.” Isn’t there something wrong with that? Wouldn’t it be better to make the training a priority? Allow the new pilot and the experienced pilot to fly together to Baltimore, and allow the new guy to watch and learn, and don’t try to send the new guy to Philly alone. Also, deliver a message to the customer, and say “I’m sorry, but we can’t send a helicopter to Philadelphia this week.”",Self-teaching,SoftwareEngineering

" I am 29 and at the start of my journey to learn the basics of programming. Why? I want to build and operate a software development agency out of South Asia.

I am under no delusions; I am searching for and will hire a top-tier Co-founder/CTO/Head of Engineering. I will lead the business side of things.

I have already been talking to people in the US and most mention the following problems they face when outsourcing/off-shoring etc:

* Communication: strong accents, difficulty understanding idioms and colloquialisms
* Time difference: limited overlapping work hours, potential delays
* Cultural differences: limited understanding of product and customer needs
* Priorities: uncertainty about project ranking, the potential for the sudden departure
* Rare success stories: requires deep cultural understanding and hands-on management
* 'Senior devs' who are junior or fresh. Talent agencies bullshit them.

Solutions I have in mind:

1. Only hire developers with strong technical English along with successful test scores in IELTS/TOEFL etc.
2. Follow a schedule that offers a 4-hour overlap with Eastern and Central US.
3. Hire those with at least 3 years of experience. In those 3 years, they should have worked on clients/products from US/Canada/Australia, and Western Europe only.
4. Only offer full-time/dedicated staff that the client can manage as they see fit and will integrate into their communication/reporting/working tool stack.
5. We will offer no single developer but teams of software developers. The smallest team offering will comprise 3 mid-tier devs working under 1 senior dev (team of 4)
6. The client gets to interview, screen, and test them for the first 2 weeks at zero cost.

Now, with all the above information in mind, I have 3 questions:

1. What level of conceptual understanding of programming do I need to have to communicate with my CTO/Co-Founder effectively?
2. What do you think of my solutions? What would you add?
3. What other issues did you face with outsourcing and off-shore teams?",How was your experience with local vs off-shore software engineers?,SoftwareEngineering

"Hello! I want to collect some opinions on a topic we discussed with friends. Imagine you are reviewing a Pull Request and are pretty happy about it. But then you notice something that:

* introduces technical debt for no reason
* takes 60 seconds to fix

but at the same time

* the fix wouldn't change anything today
* it's unrelated to the main topic of a PR

Would you block it? Would you leave a comment but let it pass?

Mainly, we spoke about unnecessary side effects in the code. Here are some stripped-down but real examples:

    def compute_results(results: List[int]) -&gt; None:
        results.clear()
        for i in range(N):
            results.append(compute(i))

could be replaced by a pure function that doesn't mutate input arguments

    def compute_results() -&gt; List[int]:
        results = []
        for i in range(N):
            results.append(compute(i))
        return results

or imagine an unnecessary global variable:

    double LEARNING_RATE;
    
    double compute(x) {
        int g = ... some algorithm with x...
        return LEARNING_RATE*g;
    }
    
    int main() {
        LEARNING_RATE = 0.1;
        .. use compute(2);
        return 0;
    }

that could be removed completely

    double compute(x, learningRate) {
        int g = ... some algorithm with x...
        return learningRate*g;
    }
    
    int main() {
        double learningRate = 0.1;
        .. use compute(2, learningRate);
        return 0;
    }

To create your own requirements engineering process, use the representative process below and add stuff from page 44. Alternatively, remove some stuff from the representative process below or replace it.

&amp;#x200B;

A representative requirements engineering process (page 46 of the book + comments based on the book):

1. **Define business requirements** (fill the Vision and Scope template - page 81 tells you how to fill it. A business requirement is for example to increase market share in region X by Y % within Z months)
2. **Identify user classes** and their characteristics (various groups of users for your product that might differ in their use, frequency, features, etc. Page 105 details the process)
3. **Identify user representatives** (identify an individual who can serve as a representative for each group of users)
4. **Identify requirements decision-makers** (people who will resolve conflicting requirements, evaluate change requests, etc. Page 108 or for Agile page 115)
5. **Plan elicitation** (plan how you will do requirements elicitation and management, page 129. This includes planning an approach, i.e. interviews, workshops, focus groups, observations, questionnaires, system interface analysis, user interface analysis, document analysis - pages 121-128)
6. **Work with user representatives to identify user requirements** (explore the tasks user representatives are trying to accomplish with software and express user requirements as use cases, user stories, or scenarios - page 144. A user requirement is for example to print a mailing label for a parcel)
7. **Prioritize user requirements** (the team must implement the highest value or most timely functionality first.  So, an analytical approach must determine the implementation priority of product features, use cases, user stories, or functional requirements. Based on this, you can determine what release or increment will contain the requirement. - page 313 has more details)
8. **Flesh out user requirements** (do another round of elicitation, for example another interview stakeholders, and this time add more detail and specificity to user requirements. The first round only identified high-level requirements without any detail. The first round was for example to print a mailing label for a parcel. This round is where you ask about the required fields that should be included in the mailing label, whether there are any selectable lists, etc. and you collect all the details)
9. **Derive functional requirements from user requirements** (what the system needs to do to support the user requirement. One possible approach is to use case scenarios depicting the interaction between a primary actor and the system. So, in this case the steps that the system must do can be derived from the scenario and added as functional requirements, grouped by a feature name. One product feature can have many requirements)
10. **Model the requirements** (an analysis model is a diagram that depicts requirements visually.  Models can reveal incorrect, inconsistent, missing, and superfluous requirements. Models include data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, state-transition diagrams, state tables, dialog maps, decision trees, and other. (pages 93-95, 103, 106, 109, 112))
11. **Specify non-functional requirements** (go beyond the functional descriptions to understand what is required to achieve success. Sometimes, merely performing a function is not enough because the function does not satisfy the required qualities. For example, performance, availability, reliability, usability, modifiability and other)
12. **Review requirements** (assemble a small team of reviewers for a peer review to represent different perspectives, such as analyst, customer, developer, and testers. Have them carefully examine the written requirements, analysis models, and related information for defects. page 329 has more details)
13. **Create user interface and technical prototypes** (when uncertain about the requirements, construct a prototype. A partial, possible, or preliminary implementation, to make the concepts and possibilities more tangible. This achieves a mutual understanding of the problem being solved between developers and users. It also helps to validate requirements. Page 295 has more information on how to create a prototypes.)
14. **Develop or evolve architecture** (it is possible to decide on the overall type of the system based on having requirements. One approach is a decomposition of the overall system into subsystems. And further, each subsystem can have some components.)
15. **Allocate requirements to subsystems or components** (requirements for a complex product that contains multiple subsystems must be allocated between software, hardware, and human subsystems and components. Page 439 has more information)
16. **Develop tests from requirements** (tests are an alternative view of the requirements. Writing tests requires you to think how to verify the required functionality, or a non-functional requirement was correctly implemented. Map tests to functional and non-functional requirements to make sure no requirement was overlooked. Agile projects often create acceptance tests in lieu of  detailed functional requirements. That means whether the solution is fit for use and meets user needs.)
17. **Validate user requirements, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, analysis models, and prototypes** (Sign-off by stakeholders. Modeling checking for correctness, completeness, consistency. Another approach is to simulate the system using a commercial tool, i.e. executable mock-ups.)

Finally, you will repeat the whole process for all subsequent iterations (assuming you're using an iterative SDLC. Agile is always iterative.)

&amp;#x200B;

To improve your requirements engineering process, once you have one, use page 517.

Note that the above process doesn't include everything available, and isn't tailored to your specific project. Use page 44 to see what else you could put in there to tailor it. This is an iterative process and can be used with Agile projects.",Software requirements courses,SoftwareEngineering

"Along with other ubiquitous industry terms like ""Architecture"" and ""Infrastructure"" I feel that ""Technical Debt"" has now been overused and is now too vague to be useful. I will provide some examples but in general I would like to her everyone's unbiased opinion.

I think the typical definition of 'technical debt' is akin to: 

&gt;Someone took a shortcut to get something to ship, and now we have to write code to fix the shortcut and ""do it the right way.""

I'm actually fine with that definition. Here are some examples where usage of the term 'technical debt' gets fuzzy:

* No shortcuts at all but a carefully built, extensible, well running application was built on a library or runtime that has a new version out. Is that technical debt?
* A key library is expectantly sunset. 
* A SaaS product can handle a central component of our architecture and we can now 'buy' instead of 'build' and we get 10x more features. Does our current solution now contain technical debt?
* Roadmap items that require a lot of upfront tooling before we can even touch them. 
* Bugs that have workarounds.
* DevOps pipelines that remain painfully slow because of understaffing.

Anyway, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on what you and your teams consider technical debt as well as some other scenarios where calling something technical debt is a bit of a grey area.",In your own words: What is technical debt?,SoftwareEngineering

"Hey, for those of you in fintech. Let’s say you’re building an application which has various wallets. Let’s say, you have a CAD wallet and a USD wallet. Now your system allows you to trade some USD to some provider at some rate, then the provider gives you some CAD. I have a little problem currently and i wanted to gain some insight on how it’s actually done. 

I have read about storing currencies in their lowest denomination on the application and db level to prevent floating points and what not. That makes sense to me. But what doesn’t make sense to me is handling the rates from the exchange. Let’s say a rate is 1.2 to convert from USD to CAD, does the rate have to be converted to the lowest denominator as well? Because multiplying a rate(float) by some other currency will cause errors. 

If i’m multiplying the rate and the monetary values by 100 (assuming all currencies base value is 100), do I have to divide the stored monetary values by 100x100 when displaying to the frontend?

"If we assume the current hype cycle is correct, that in the near future all code will be written by large language models (LLM) given some minimal input by the few remaining developers.

I think you can argue that the amazing innovation in software is from developers strugging to write something, and then coming up with new mental models and abstractions that they then implement as something new that lets them do the old thing easier or do a thing that was never possible before.

 I've lived a VERY unorthodox life thus far. I'm currently 25 years old, at the age of 16 I started a business and dropped out of high school. I've now sold that business and I'm ready to move on to the next chapter of my life. Out of necessity, I learned Python, JS, and HTML/CSS. From a young age, I've always been into computers and technology in general. Software development is something I find fascinating and would like to pursue. I would love to return to school to get a CS or SE degree but this seems unlikely due to my past and almost zero math skills.

"Need some help guiding me to correct path. Goal is to process multiple video streams at the same time. Also need to store the streams for training models.

Current system is pretty much all proprietary and sort of working but it is not very fault tolerant. We keep having some random issues with it and not sure how to improve things. I think we should change the architecture to make it more resilient.

What we have now is a script that acts as a sort of scheduler. It receives commands over websocket to start and stop capturing streams, captures them, stores a copy on a disk and also pipes it to ffmpeg. Ffmpeg then takes the stream from stdin and dumps frames to stdout that get piped to script that runs the model on said frames.

The issues we keep having:

* If there is a network issue and stream breaks then the whole pipeline needs to be restarted, ffmpeg doesn't seem to be able to handle it. Restarting pipeline is slow and model loses it's state.
* It all runs in Python and if some part of the code gets blocked or runs slow or all GPUs are busy, the whole pipeline can grind to an halt. Debugging this is a nightmare because any part of the pipeline can be the cause. Also the files stored on disk seem to be affected (shorter than they should be).

What I'd like to have: 

* System where this pipeline is cut up into smaller independent parts
* Model should never be restarted because of network issues
* Fault in one part of pipeline shouldn't affect others

"Traditionally, I'm used to separation of the interface and a class implementation. Basically for every class there would be a test implementation on the same interface. Even when a class did not have any other implementation other than the test implementation the interface was mandatory.

Lately I've been moving away from this as I feel like the extra layer does not neccesarily add anything. 

\- When I'm writing small single responsibility classes, there will only be one public method anyway.

\- Test implementations are no longer neccesary with the current mocking frameworks

\- Because of the above, the function of an interface would be there to vary the implementation at run time. But making an interface upfront seems to fall in YAWGNI territory - the interface should be made when you actually create a new implementation.

Now in my current job I also need to review and analyse quite a lot of code, and I'm using static analysis tools for this. All the tools have a tendency to give a lower score to classes when there is a dependency between two classes, instead of a dependency to an interface. And I see where they are coming from - but as I indicated above I'm currently missing the advantages of doing so.

"I have received a software engineering project. And I need some advice on the best practices for it. I am using Asp .net core for backend, Angular TS for Frontend and MSSQL Server for DB. The project infrastructure is built on Azure. The login system is via Azure AD and AADB2C. 


Earlier the web application was used just by a set of people in England. Now this new project is like an extension of it at the global level. So there's an office of this international organization in US, Australia, France and the organization wants that each team in different regions will have access to their own country's data. Data from different dbs could be stored in a DW for reporting purposes. The manager has the privilidge to explore the data for different regions.


I came up with the understanding of the architecture for it. Single tenant application but having different dbs as per the regions. But in a recent meeting they said that the functionality of the web system may also change depending on how different teams want the workflow to be. This has confused me like they want a single website but for different regions which could have different functionalities. I really need help from senior software engineers regarding what is the best approach to follow for setting up the infrastructure for such project. What tools I may need to use additionally If needed and What things to keep in mind.

"**TL;DR**

Incompetent managers destroy careers/dreams/lifes of new young developers, and budget of companies.

**Full story**

This post is not about me. I'm almost 20 years in software development, I was lucky to work mostly with good engineers, managers and peers. I grew a lot with them, and I have good manager right now.

Since 3 years I'm doing technical interviews to the company I work for. Our process checks coding skills (any language to be chosen by candidate), system design and overall technology knowledge.

Questions are simple (coding task is little harder than famous FizzBuzz), design a system where there are 3 API endpoint, 2 events, 1 or 2 queues, 1 database. These are questions thst competent medium/senior solves in 10-20 minutes max!

Recently I've interviewed few Engineering Managers, who claimed in their CVs that they have circa 10-15 years of experience. They can't properly write 2 or 3 classes with 3 properties each, and 2-3 public methods. They write one big nested `if/elseif/elseif/else code`. In system design they can't explain what arrows means on theirs diagram, or where are boundaries of each domain or service, everything tightly coupled.

When we talk about theory they claim they know e.g. DDD, but they have no idea about what ""domain"" is, what ""entity"" is, or what ""domain event"" is.

When we talk about processes, some of them claim that they don't do tests because it slows down the development (and they handle platforms that makes millions of $$$).

Of course there are good ones, but maybe 1 or 2 per each 10.

If anyone of you got under such Engineering Manager in first few years of your career you would be doomed. Imagine such people being your bosses? Freaking DISASTER.

Please don't think I'm bragging here or being arogant. No - I'm just fairly average dev. I'm not a rockstar, I barely passed FAANG interview once in my career (but I rejected it for personal reasons). 

But The level of these Impostors? Ridiculous!

I know I'll get few downvotes now, I know some will tell me that Engineering Managers shouldn't be experts. Of course, but they should have basic knowledge. For God's sake.

How the hell such weak EMs can help others grow if they can't do basic engineering? 

Seriously - if you're one of such EM, please change career, and leave this industry!

"So I've been working for over 5 years in a huge company and decided to change my employer from a huge company who builds app for themself to a smaller company who builds apps for customers.

Now since I'm in this new company I've been working on a website including backend for a customer. Everything nice and good. I'm mainly frontend dev so I focus on this. There I build everything from scratch what really made fun.

But when I have to work in the backend my boss always comes to me and tell me that they do this in a different way and that he want's to change it so that it looks like everyone else. I think that is really strange, because I haven't got any instructions on how to do something.

My boss always want's to copy some code from all over the whole DevOps Server and ""reuse"" it. But whenever I made a suggestion to change this (especially in the backend) because it's better, I get rejected because it should look like everyone else. Even if my version is way faster then the old one.

Is this really that important to keep the code always the same? Especially when it has better performance?

"We have a single Java component which reads messages from multiple sources, REST, kafka, files and ingest them and saves them into cassandra. The component also hands over the messages to processing component so that processing component does not have to hit cassandra (helping us reduce cloud cost involved in db reads). Cassandra and message processing component are running in cloud. but the Java component does not. We are planning to refactor the Java component before moving it to cloud. We have thought of following:

* We want to break the component into multiple stand alone consumer components, each of which will consume from single source.
* We might need multiple instances of each of these components running. For example, we can have multiple kafka consumers that can read from kafka efficiently. 
* Currently, if a Java component is reading from specific source, it updates this information in db and any other instance of component first checks this information in db to check if there is any unconsumed source and then starts consuming from that source. So db information kind of provide locking mechanism to avoid parallel reads from the same source.  **Q1.** Is this correct way to implement this functionality? What is industry standard approach (any well know library / approach)?
* Kafka consumer cluster can orchestrate consuming messages. So we wont need any such locking mechanism for kafka consumers. **Q2.** But how should we implement locking mechanism for REST and file consumers. 
* **Q3.** Will it be overkill to replicate kafka's architecture for consuming from these other sources? That is, does it make sense / sounds feasible to implement consumer cluster which read from REST (or files) and have kafka like features (master-slave redundancy, master election etc)? **Q4.** Are there already such libraries? If yes, can someone point in right direction (may be a link to high level API / library that Kafka implements in order to achieve those features, so that we can also implement it to quickly inherit those features. Or Kafka simply implements these features from scratch?)
* **Q5.** Is simply containerising these small consumer components and running them on kubernetes cluster enough (with locking still done through db)?

Hi, I’m Lucas. After getting my master degree from NCU(ranking 501 from CWUR in 2019), I went to design Android app and web for a WiFi music box. After providing the convenient interfaces and rich media functions like online radio and local music, our products became more attractive to the customers and this increased the chip sales in the market.

After that, I joined in a web design team and my main role is to create new services. I developed a web interface to operate on the surveillance devices and manage the user permissions. I also added a log function to track users' behaviour. This working experience helps me a lot in the web development.

In my third position, I worked as an Android developer to develop a live streaming app which helps sell products. 

Now, I work for myself. I’m building a simple ERP system for private schools and small shops. Python and Django are used for the backend. And of course, html/js/css are used for the frontend.

"Vulnerabilities can be hidden everywhere in a container. Every layer of the image can pose a security risk, making container images a substantial security concern.

While there are various commercial vulnerability scanning tools available, Mergify found that most of them could not manage the vulnerability lifecycle effectively. They turned to open-source security scanners and found Trivy to be useful in solving the vulnerability lifecycle problem.

Trivy generates a file that includes all the CVEs that affect the image, which can be committed to the repository to track vulnerabilities over time. The workflow that Mergify implemented is to run an image scan every day, create a pull request with the changes detected, merge automatically if there are no new CVEs, and comment on the pull request if new CVEs are detected. This workflow helps to track the different scans done over time, making vulnerability lifecycle management easy for the engineers at Mergify.",Level Up Your Docker Security: Uncover Mergify's Battle-Tested Workflow for Container Image Scanning,SoftwareEngineering

"Dear  newly appointed engineering managers, congratulations on this  exciting  milestone in your career! As you transition from being a  developer to a  manager, here are some tips to help you succeed:

\-   Make sure you understand where members of your team are professionally   and where they want to be. Try to assign them task that help them get   there, to the extent possible. For example, if you have a full stack   developer that has recently done a lot of frontend but now wants to dive   more into the backend, try to set him with relevant tasks.

\-  Don't  be afraid to delegate tasks and empower your team members to  take  ownership of their work. At this stage you're used to doing  everything  by yourself, cause it may be ""the fastest path"". Don't be  tempted to  doing that, it'd make you not have enough time to make sure  the team is  in the right direction, and would cut your team's wings. If  you always  do that specific thing that only you know, no one else  would never know  how to do it. Now is the time to teach others how to  do things you used  to do. You shouldn't ever be a bottleneck.

\-  Communicate your  expectations clearly and transparently with your  team, and make sure to  actively listen to their feedback. If you need  something ready by some  date, make sure you let them know this as you  assign the task. If you  want them to do something with a specific tech  stack or in a specific  way, let them know to help them save time and  not wander in areas where  you know they shouldn't go. Of course, do so  while being open to their  thoughts, perhaps they think of a better way?  that's where their  feedback is important.

\-  Foster a no-ego culture within the team.  Make sure they know you  always want to hear their opinion, especially  when it contradicts  yours. Let them know you know you're not perfect, no  one person is  always right. You want to hear it when they think you're  wrong in  something. In cases where you are indeed wrong you can save  your team  crucial time just by hearing other opinions.  
\- Celebrate  wins and  learn from failures as a team. Just finished a version?  celebrate!  something went wrong in production? learn what exactly lead  to it and  how you can improve as a team in the future to avoid this.

Best   of luck on this exciting new journey! I know this transition may be   overwhelming, so I am here for you if you have any questions about   anything. feel free to ask questions :)",Becoming an engineering manager after being a developer? here are some tips to help the transition go smoothly,SoftwareEngineering

"Hello everyone,

I'm a software engineer seeking advice on how to navigate my career path. I have experience with Golang, Python, and JavaScript, but I don't have a degree. I decided to switch careers at the beginning of 2022 and completed a 12-week software engineering immersive program in May 22 with some preparation. I spent about five weeks on my own grinding LeetCode and found a job as a software engineer in a startup in June 22 (a friend referred me, and I did really well on my interview - I solved array and binary search problems). I was mostly working with React, but I didn't enjoy the job very much. Since it was low-paying and low-stress, I dedicated all my free time to learning as much as I could about CS foundations and backend systems. I stayed there until the new year, because in December, I passed a pretty long backend apprenticeship interview at another company (node service as home test, 5h on site coding, ood, system design). In January, I started an apprenticeship in a new company, which has provided me with more opportunities to learn and improve. My main issue is that it can be stressful at times, and there is little help provided from my peers (they are overwhelmed with their workloads from my point of view). While working in this job, I have learned a lot about backend foundations, AWS services, and picked up a new language (Golang), which I really value, and I know it is going to help me in the long term. However, due to recent layoffs (12% of employees), I am unsure about my future at this company. My current apprenticeship is ending in a week, and instead of a full-time conversion, I was offered an eight-week extension with no promise.

I would love to hear any advice or insights from the community on what steps I should take next to continue building my career in software engineering. How should I approach this? Should I continue to work at this company and hope for a conversion, or should I start looking for new opportunities elsewhere? What areas should I focus on improving in my skillset to make myself more marketable to potential employers? Should I start brushing up my leetcode? (I am comfortable with easy’s and mediums with more basic data structures, meaning there’s a lot of room for improvement!)

However, it looks like there was some remnant files that were left in the PC during the deletion and that has been phoning home to the software company any time my friend opens the computer.

* Obviously the program was deleted and yet the software company was receiving calls from some remnant file in the computer left after the deletion. And so I wish to know, can a pirated software still ping/phone home to mother company even when deleted?
* My completely layman's understanding of how software systems call home from a computer is that the specific program needs to be opened in the computer before it can phone home. In this case, the program wasn't opened because it had been deleted. And so my question is, can software still phone home from a computer without being opened?
* Third, when a company engineers a software so that a pirated version sends signals/calls to mother company from a user's Pc, does the company have a way to find out when that software is deleted by the user? In other words will they know the exact time the software is deleted from a user's system?

I'm not a Cryptographer, nor am I a Quantum Computation Engineer, as much as I wish I could wake up one morning as someone else... So, I came across an article on IBM's website, which will get it's due [credit.](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/what-is-quantum-safe-cryptography-and-why-do-we-need-it) &lt;=====Right there.

Anyway, this is just a little piece of advice for anyone listening, Bad-Actors exist. They might be your neighbors for all you know. Ya, that sweet lady in her late 70's is probably trying to scam you somehow, believe it. But that's not news. You knew that already.

Here's the news, quantum mechanics is compleeeexxxx, but I cracked enough of it to know it's more dangerous than any bomb we've ever built. And you add unregulated, unfettered advancements in AI to the quantum realm, hell you set AI upon the task of cracking the mysteries of the quantum realm, and the speed of our advancement exceeds the most imaginative child's wildest dreams. It sounds like Sci-Fi, it really does. It's [here](https://quantum-computing.ibm/) though, if you're interested.

Quantum entanglement, all by it's lonesome, forces us to question the laws that govern our every-day lives. Two particles, entangled, can share the physical properties like spin, position, and polarization, to name a few, across any distance. In theory this happens instantaneously, in practice we utilize this to create quantum computers, and who knows what else...

So, to get back on track: I'm warning you all!!! ahhh, queue the ominous music and scary noises. Quantum computing is available for individuals to start learning, and someone with enough intelligence, information, and determination could probably build one at home. Other countries are undoubtably on the quantum train too. My point is this, quantum algorithms can crack the best of our encryptions quick enough to make any hacker gasp.

Now, I don't know how many passwords you've entered today, but imagine every system you tried to log into was shut down. Shit, Google's Search Engine was down. That would be the start of something catastrophic right? Even a day of that would send people into a panic. Quantum safe cryptography is the only way to prevent quantum abuse of classical computation systems. Perhaps not the only way, and perhaps that's not a fool-proof method of data security. I mean after-all, the quantum realm implies some odd connectivity of everything... Theories be damned for the moment, I need to make this plea sociologically, to the human in you. We need people researching in this field, we need Quantum Engineers to lend some of their thought to the problems of safely transitioning into a Quantum Era. It will change things, and it's coming a hell of a lot faster than most of you think.",A Move to Quantum Safe Cryptography,SoftwareEngineering

3 non technical bosses a 1 fully remote dev, well call him Dave. 

 I spearheaded a redesign of our database; it was ridiculously setup and I proposed a new schema to our singular developer and he took it well.

now I have been tasked with redesigning our GUI given the restructuring of the database. Therefore. I've asked my non-technical bosses if I could have access to github to see the code for our software so I can have a better understanding of how it's all set up. 

They talked to the dev Dave. He seemed very off and made every excuse about why he doesn't want to share (for the record, nobody has ever seen it.) I suggested just giving me view access in github so there's no chance I alter anything, and that I won't waste his time by asking questions. 0 downside. He convinced my boss that he should only have access. To me this makes no sense and I think he's hiding something.

I think Dave the dev might be intentionally working very slowly and taking home a huge salary, and lying about his logged hours. My non technical bosses are very naive and have no idea how dev projects actual take so they take him at his word. Does this seem likely to be true?

The interview was not very technical they seemed to be assessing our soft skills more (group and individual). Everyone else was a computer science grad with a lot of experience.

* Generate and display 3D models
* Authentication
* Data collection during training to give future suggestions for trainee and admin

"Hello everyone, I am a self-learning backend developer in my 3rd year of college. I am not in a rush to find a job as I still have one more year to learn. Although I prefer backend development, I have noticed that people's portfolios often showcase a juicy website, even if it's just a normal MVC backend. This can still be enough for an entry-level job, but I am too focused on backend development, leaving me no time to build a web client interface to showcase my skills.  


Which position should I apply in the future with these skill-set:  


Here is my skill set: Backend (Main):

* NestJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, TypeORM, RabbitMQ, GraphQL
* I can implement Hexagonal Architecture, MVC, Domain Driven Design, Event Sourcing, Microservice.
* I can write Unit, Integration and E2E tests

Frontend (just enough to make a simple interface, not good at CSS)

* HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, ReactJS, Angular, VueJS (For every framework, I only know how to make a simple SPA, routing stuff, maybe state management, but nothing too advanced)

Miscellaneous: Linux (Gentoo), Docker, setting up basic CI-CD with Github Actions, combining with testing and publishing packages, Neovim, and using ChatGPT for automating tasks.

Project: I am currently building a Warehouse service that manages a warehouse with event sourcing (backend only). I plan to complete it and create a simple frontend.

Hello, I will do my best to keep this concise and brief. 

I am 27/m with a wife and three children and live in the Midwest. I am a full time Journeyman Industrial Mechanic for one of the big three American Automakers. I have a significant amount of down/free time at work which has allowed me to pursue higher education. I currently am attending University of Maryland Global Campus. This fall I will be going into my 2nd year of undergrad. Now I will get to my question(s).. 

My initial plan was to transfer to Oregon State University this fall as a full time online student for their BS in CS, and to finish my degree in 3 years. I planned to transfer there because from what I've read, they seem to have a more rigorous and respected program compared to UMGC. Recently I discovered that UMGC is accepting training from my time in the military as 30 elective credit hours. In doing so, my degree would only take 2 years to complete, compared to 3 years at OSU. 

To get to my point: 

I am a full time working adult, with a family in children, and I work in a unrelated career field. So internships/co-ops are off the table. My goal with obtaining my degree is to learn as much as possible and become as prepared   As possible to change careers. My degree is not to check a box. 

Should I stick to my original plan of 3 years of education at OSU in their CS program, or should I finish an accelerated path at UMGC and try to get into the field a year sooner? Both degrees would be a BS in CS. I would still take all major and gen ed requirements. I would take little to no electives at UMGC, and would take 30 credit hours of electives at OSU. 

Neither school cost me anything because of my GI Bill and employer tuition assistance. 

Being in the Midwest, does either school hold more weight over the other? 

Since I have no work experience in this field, would OSU program prepare me more than UMGC? Or would UMGC prepare me enough and I should start working sooner?

Hi everyone ! I was wanting to get some career advice! I recently graduated as a mechanical engineer in 2022 and my first job ended up being a software developer job. 

I applied for one of those graduate programs at a big company and since they basically mass hired people HR ended up randomly assigning jobs and I ended up in a software developer position. It was really hard at the beginning as I didn’t have any developing background but a few months later im now doing frontend work and will move to learn backend soon. 

Although this is not ME, I really enjoy this job and would like to continue developing my career in this direction. However, my college background is not CS.

Do yall think my non-cs background will be a limiting factor in the future when looking for a new job? Should I look into doing a CS masters or maybe getting some java/react/c#/etc certifications online? maybe even some bootcamps?Or is experience more valuable in this field?

"I'm currently working as a medior software developer at a corporate, with comfortable compensation, and even space for growth, while studying my first year at uni (I started coding really early and because of that I've been able to land a great job so soon with almost 6 years of experience at 21). I've tried companies of all different sizes, from startups to international corporates, and while I'm currently pretty happy, I realize that this isn't what I want to do my whole life, and because I barely learn anything at uni, and probably won't at least in my bachelors, I'm thinking of switching my studies to something, that could be useful to me when I eventually will want to switch away from software engineering.

I'm most drawn to international relations as I'm very interested in politics and even worked on some political campaigns. However, it's a very competitive field, that I see requires full dedication to ""make it"", for that reason it might not be so suitable for me.

The other idea was just simply switching my major to Artificial Intelligence and stay in Comp Sci, as it's a field I don't have a lot of experience with, and is very interesting.

"I joined a small startup as a software engineer about a year ago. Our engineering team is me, one other engineer, and the CTO. We have a fairly small code base for a web app, consisting of an express.js api and a react client. They started building the app 4-5 years ago and the CTO probably wrote ~50% of the code that remains today. 

When I joined, they had just begun converting to typescript from JavaScript, there were zero tests for anything (not even unit tests!), they committed directly to main/master constantly and barely ever used PRs or code reviews, and deployments were handled by the CTO running a command from his personal laptop and crossing his fingers that he set all of his environment variables correctly.

Fast forward to today, and we’ve converted about half of the code to typescript, we started writing unit tests and the api is at about 30% coverage (client still has zero tests), 100% of our infrastructure is now IaC (terraform), we use a linter and code formatter, we’re tracking issues with linear, we’ve adopted standard git workflows, we have a proper deployment pipeline that enabled us to convert our app into a SaaS product that we have running in half a dozen different environments (generating WAY more revenue now), and we have status pages that continuously monitor for downtime.

All of these improvements happened because I begged the CTO for them. My CTO is very intelligent, he’s a fast learner, and I genuinely enjoy working with him (and I believe that feeling is mutual), but he has some awful coding habits and a lot to learn. For example, pretty much every page on the client is a single, 1000 line function. No components that we can reuse… just massive files that are next to impossible to understand.

The CTO reviews most PRs, but he approves pretty much anything you submit, so the other engineer’s code is typically just as bad as the CTO’s. I’m honestly not sure if they don’t know how to write maintainable code, or if they just don’t care, but I can’t continue working on their buggy shit spaghetti code forever - it’s not any fun. I also don’t think anyone else has a clue how bad the code quality is because our CEO frequently states that we have “3 very senior engineers.” (The CEO is also a coder, but he’s very junior)

What advice do you have? How do I tactfully tell my boss (CTO) that he’s been writing shit code for 4 years and I need him to stop doing that? How common is this problem, really?

"Hi everyone,

I have been working as an Agile coach for the past 8 years. In my current organization, we do not have proper feedback culture and I have a question about how can we provide sufficient feedback to the engineers. Please notice that a year ago we have added internal code reviews which have been proven to work exceptionally well.

Our goal is to provide a process or tool that will assist them to improve their Technical (mainly) and Soft skills.

So far we have seen various 360 tools, however, I am afraid that this is not the ideal way for assessing technical skills, skills specific to an individual project, or granular performance indicators, since it typically involves many people with different backgrounds and levels of involvement with the reviewer.

360-degree feedback may be too subjective to assess some aspects of a software engineer’s performance.

I have changed jobs a few times but in all my jobs I am just a doer. I mean by the time I joint a team, an existing app has been written and all what I do is adding new features or fixing bugs. I mean it's still challenging from time to time but once I am used to the codebase and domain, then it's not challenging at all. Sometimes it feels like knowing the domain is probably more than important then technical stacks as the overall architecture is stable (or there is no time to make fundamental change to the app).

The difference is not that one goes to an IIT institution and the other does not. The only difference is that one knows that they have infinite potential and the other does not know that they also have infinite potential.

When I was in college, I used to think this a lot. What are the things that make IIT so special. Why are so many students running behind it. Are the faculties so good? But non iitian institutions also have good faculties. Is the course structure better? But many have the same course as well. Are the hotel facilities, food, classrooms better? Are the practical labs better? You can find ample examples denying this. Then why are sooo many students dying to go to those colleges.

I am in one of the FAANG right now, and I know the answers now. My company is filled with both IITians and non IITians and the only similarity they have is that they all know that they have the potential to do anything, they have the power even to change this world. I have never seen an IITian doubting themselves if they are capable of doing something or not. They are very sure, they will do it. 

If every student understands that they are also capable of doing wonders, they are not different from those who study in a different building, holding a tag of IIT with them, then it will solve many problems. The main cause of a lack of self confidence comes mainly from our homes. In India, most parents don’t have trust and confidence in their children. They have seen their loved ones, doing stupid stuffs when they were young, and they don’t expect them to change much when they are in their 20s. They train their kids to secure a job, big enough to survive with the inflation. There were not many job opportunities for us a few decades ago, but we can do whatever we want and achieve anything we can think of today. 

Many fear from dreaming big. I am not sure what they are even afraid of. There is no tax on thinking big yet. If we will not consider planning about being a better person, better than what a non-iitian mentality person can even think of, then we will never be able to grow.

The test isnt like what ive seen before, from experience, they'd give basic tasks involving algorithms and arrays. This, however, is asking me to build an address book web application, implementing a front and backend (they havent used these terms though). I have the knowledge to do it and frankly its fairly easy, just time consuming. 

One point though is theyve asked us to do it fully object oriented. Now im using purely javascript for this as it the language I know very well, more specifically React.js and Node.js. I know all they want from this is to check if I understand OOP, which im confident I do, just I cant find a place where OOP is needed. 

The backend will just be API endpoints which I will be using express to implement. I could potentially implement some sort of OOP with the data but really only one class could be used as the only data we have recieved is a 4 element JSON array with keys: firstname, lastname, phone, email. I cant really use any OOP techniques such as abstraction, inheritance, interfaces, etc because the data set is so small. 

Finally we come to react, ive already got a front end implemented but ive done it functionally as thats what ive learnt and also be told to use on the internet. Furthermore, ive been told the devs of react want you to start using functions rather than classes as many of these class properties and features are being depricated.

Further points that may be useful, this is for a graduate role and have said they dont expect us to know everything. Im just worried that it will ruin my chances becuase I didnt really implement and OOP becuase there was no need for it.

"One of the advantages of the new breed of cloud development environments is their ability to be used for collaboration. This includes things like link sharing, preview, ... But also actual developer collaboration in the realm of pair programming, etc.

Some of these solutions specifically talk about more than one developer being able to code interactively on the same environment. I'm imagining pair programming, but with more than one keyboard/monitor.

I'm having a hard time understanding what situations this would be useful for, but would like to get a feel for other's opinions. I don't want to affect the poll too much, so will add my thoughts in a comment.

"Hi everyone,

I'm a reasonably experienced programmer (15+ years of C/C++, C#, Java, PHP, JS, Unity and more). However, the first half of this period was spent working in research labs supporting one-off prototypes for experiments (in academia but also for a couple of big companies) and the next bit has been teaching undergrads on an arts-based technology programme that doesn't delve too much into software engineering.

The result is, while I can write code pretty well across a load of languages and technologies, my knowledge of contemporary software development practices is pretty rusty. I use Git, but not much beyond add, commit, push, pull and, rarely, branch. I have touched on containers, but only really to replace MAMP for simple local development. I've not written a unit test since my degree 20 years ago! Dev ops, that's the people who do... umm. The Cloud, someone else's computer, but what food do I need to give my Kubernetes and does it need a daily walk? You get the idea :-).

Out of interest more than anything, I'm really keen to find out more about contemporary software development and engineering practices though. And with xmas coming up, I'm wondering if there's a nice overview book that I could get that could provide a little more depth on the key things that programmers today are doing in a product context and how they all fit together.

Any recommendations greatly appreciated. Could be more traditional factual/learning books, but also popular science style too even.

"I am starting a new project and just trying to spend the extra time to think about the system as a whole to get things lined out ahead of time. I'm not sure exactly how to approach this challenge listed below and just looking for general advice or to be pointed to appropriate resources.

Overall concept: It's a multi-user platform(web app) that will allow the end-user to get data from multiple apis(depending on specific desire) through a portal, the data will be combined to make something more useful and convenient for the user. 

Problem: Should I use something like Kong or Tyk being as each individual api request will need to be rate limited depending on how many credits the end-user has pre-purchased. Also, some the api's will need to be fired off in sequence in some scenarios, and the data from the response of api A may be needed to send along with subsequent requests. 

Just to satisfy curiosity, this platform will fall into B2B/SEO industry. 

So, I guess my question more specifically is this, will something like Kong or Tyk fulfill most of these needs or will I be better off starting from the ground up? Also, this platform will be built in the context of Node.js backend most likely, although I have not ruled out using python as of yet, I just have more experience with js.",Aggregate API data manually or use something like Kong?,SoftwareEngineering

I am working on an observability tool for developers. Idea behind it is:

* to uncover the data/object flows
* identify the anomalies in the data as it moves from one class/method to another(this will observe data for sometime to find all the possible combinations, it will raise an alert if there would be difference in data). 
*  uncovering which method takes the most time etc. 
* Flow visualization can also be used as a form of documentation of ever changing code base and understanding the undocumented part of the code. 

Moreover, I also plan to add a functionality of ""indexing"" the codebase allowing developers to search the logic/flows of their choice - for eg how the app behaves for user A (lets say a stripe) as compared to user B(appstore user) and output should be complete flow end to end.

Like Docker, it uses OCI for isolation from the host operating system, but simplifies integration with the host, for example, by importing a user's home directory. However, unlike the patterns promulgated in the Dockerverse, Containers are built over a complete base system, with additional tools added interactively. It does not depend on an application-specific `Dockerfile`. Rather, it allows a user to configure a build environment normally, yet without changing the host, thus offering a hybrid between full container isolation and fully-local operations.

At the moment, communities beyond Fedora, such as Debian, Ubuntu, and so on, have not adopted it. There are no binaries or packages available for targets of these kinds.

Are any alternatives available that might be more suitable for other host systems, for example, of Debian-based operating systems?",Alternatives to Fedora Toolbox for build isolation on non-RedHat Linux systems,SoftwareEngineering

"Do you have experience working with anyone who writes a lot of code, seemingly without any consideration for maintainability, flexibility, or reuse? I don't know how many times if looked back at systems I have carefully designed, only to find if statements hacked in to bypass normal functionality only because they didn't want to be bothered with trying to understand how it works. They just want to implement functionality quickly as they can.

These people seem to often be admired by management for having a reputation for getting things done, but they jeopardize the long term success of the project. The best analogy I can think of would be if a race car driver was admired for how fast he can drive, but he's constantly grinding gears and the transmission eventually siezes up. The people in charge don't know how to judge the quality of code, so they don't who is responsible for tanking productivity and grinding a project to a hault.

It becomes more frustrating when management wants to reuse functionality, and then you look to find that it is so tightly coupled to a specific use case that everything that had been done now needs to be ripped out and rewritten and management doesn't understand why it's so complicated. Often it seems that code is degrading faster than anyone can do anything about, and now there are so many convoluted special cases and branching mazes of inconsistent logic that nobody can even be begin to understand it. To avoid unintended side effects of changes, people just sprinkle in more if statements to alter the behavior of code in dozens of places.

What can be done about this? There seems to be developments who think they are good at their jobs because of how much code they write, or because of how many years they have been doing it, but they never seemed to have learned anything about software architecture the entire time they have been working. I think this is a major problem in software development that you don't hear mentioned very often.

We do code reviews of pull requests, but often people mess with systems other teams are responsible for and then they don't wind up finding out about changes until weeks later. The people doing the reviews don't understand how it works, so often all anyone can do is a superficial check of the code for things like spelling errors or immediately apparent bugs. Because people are overwhelmed with their own work, they just wind up approving code changes they dont understand just to keep things moving.

What can be done to reign in the chaos and get everyone on the same page with how things should be done? It's like if home contractors were building a house and they have a lot of people thinking things like, ""the plumbing is already installed in the kitchen, so the easiest thing to do would be to attach a hose to the sink and place the toilet on top of the counter."" Then the entire house gets hacked together in that same sort of way -- with loose wires dangling all over the place, rooms that are inaccessible because the doors had been removed, boxes stacked upon boxes that would put a hoarder to shame, the roof leaks, and tenets constantly complain about fires spontaneously arising.

"This is based on my own experience and how I have been taught agile engineering. I would like to make a few points about how I think agile is slowing down software development, and would be very glad about any friendly discussion on the issue.

For background, I taught myself programming, I worked on hobby projects alone, and only later came in touch with the industry and education around programming.

From the very beginning, I felt a big dissence about how academics and managers expected programmers to work, and how I felt to be working most productively. When I went to Uni I had a bit of a hard time accepting the Project Management side of the Software Engineering course, because I felt it didn't really address the issues programmers have during development.

With time and experience I learned that a lot of that ideology and education revolves around making *teams* work on projects, and that it was not directly linked to programming itself. However it was still presented as a solution to programming issues, which I just really couldn't submit to.

Basically I have been taught to ""not plan ahead"" and to ""not design anything you might not need"". The counter-example to agile development has always been the waterfall-model, where you plan it all out ahead, implement your design and then test it at the end. The issue given was that any failed tests caused a redesign in basically all of the previous architecture.

Agile is supposed to avoid this by implementing small increments, testing them, and iteratively approaching a solution. Another argument for this was that it is easier to react to changes in the requirements from clients. Overall, it is supposed to be more flexible and hence, agile.

To me this seemed to create a lot of friction for me as a programmer-first. If I am not supposed to make assumptions about the future or make any designs that take longer than one or two weeks, how can I be sure it is even any good? 

Just now I am working on a project, and I believe I have stumbled into this very problem. I have been working on this code for a few years now, and I have tried to integrate what I have learned into the way I work. I try to find simple solutions instead of overengineering things.

But I keep finding that my implementations are way too naive and don't really address the real underlying issue, and I end up having to scrap parts of my code because it simply isn't really needed. I had suspicions of a more complex approach before, but because of fear of overengineering, I said, ""screw it, I will just implement the simple version and see how it goes"". Turns out, the simple version doesn't really solve the full problem and I can basically rewind and implement the complex solution.

I think this is a great misunderstanding of the agile ideology. Maybe there are times where teams can get stuck in an ""analysis paralysis"" and if you don't know what you need to implement, it might be helpful to experiment and implement something akin to a prototype. But teaching engineers ""not to design"" or ""plan ahead"" in order to stay ""agile"" just seems like a bad idea. Software is incredibly complex and requires a lot of design and planning ahead.

If your requirements change mid-way then you should expect having to redesign. It is not the job of the engineer to adapt to constantly changing requirements, at least not in every environment.

I think by being so focussed on being flexible the team ceases to be productive. Because we want to be fast, we don't take time to think about the problem and all of its corner cases. We don't dare to create a big, complex design that would address all cases properly, because we need to worry that everything can change in a few weeks. So we just implement a naive solution and are left with buggy code.

I would be interested in your opinions on this. I for one will take more time with my designs in the future and make sure I have exhausted every idea before I implement something half-baked..",How Agile Engineering causes slow development,SoftwareEngineering

In the era of technology, mobiles have become unavoidable and they are the most widely used device in the world. Mobiles are full of apps, but the security of the apps has become a concern for users. Due to the momentous rise in cyber attacks, developing an app that is completely safe to use is a crucial component in mobile app development. This ensures an uncomplicated business operation. Previously,  mobile apps are mostly used for entertainment and social media, but now the time has changed they are used for various purposes including payment processes.

## Checklist to Secure Your Mobile Apps for 2023

Most apps now we use collect our behavioral data in the background. Hence you need to prioritize mobile app security more than anything in your next mobile app development. So how do you keep your personal and business data protected from such cyber attacks? No worries, in this blog we will guide you about mobile app security. Below we have given the complete checklist to secure your mobile app.

### Code Signing Certificate to Secure your Mobile App

The most vulnerable are open-source software. Cybercriminals have no trouble attacking these applications. By including a code signing certificate into your software, you may avoid these cyber-attacks. To make the app resistant to cyber criminals, the software code should be intact and safe, with a code signing certificate to avoid virus multiplication.

However, it is critical to store your signing code certificate in a secure location to avoid attackers looking for the security code. You can also keep your files secure by using non-intruding and unique passwords. Symantec code signing certificate, Comodo code signing certificate, and Sectigo code signing certificate are a few well-known code signing certificates.

## Multi-factor Authentication(MFA)

(MFA) is one of the essential factors to secure your mobile apps from cyber attacks. MFA is an authentication procedure that requires to user to provide more than one verification factor to access the target resources. The widely used authentication process only asks the user to provide a username and password, but in the case of MFA the user to need complete additional verification factors.

This can be a combination of OTP, biometric verification, calls and security questions. It ensures no one can use your device except you and can take the required measures if a cyber attack happens.

## Encrypt Mobile Communication

As the usage of cellular and wifi networks increases, cyber attacks through these channels have become very common. So encrypting the communication between mobile servers is inevitable. Powerful encryption and SSL keys like 4096, can stop the cyber attackers from decrypting the data. It is equally important to encrypt your devices as encrypting the traffic. As far as ultra-sensitive data is concerned, it is important to safeguard data from being downloaded to the end user’s device.

## Runtime App self-protection

Runtime application self-protection is an emerging technology that stops cyber attackers from attempting to hack your application and steal your data. RASP technology can be built into your application to prevent real-time attacks and detect vulnerabilities. RASP is capable of detecting, blocking, and mitigating attacks. This technology can protect your application from data without human intervention.

## Install Tamper-Detection tools

Various technologies can detect when the app code is modified and can give warnings. Therefore, you need to develop an app in a way that can give warnings when the code is changed. The leading tampering strategy is an injection, including alteration in java code and transformation in code. These tamperings can be controlled by the tamper identification software. This software can stop malware from replicating and causing further harm to your application.

## Secure Application Programming Interface

Application programming interfaces are responsible for integrating third-party services. API facilitates the systems to interconnect for data exchange and boosting functionality. An unsecured API is always vulnerable and the data exchanged can be decrypted by the attackers. To ensure the security of the application, conduct API security testing.

## Static Application Security Testing(SAST)

Static analysis is a testing strategy, that is capable of analyzing application code and security loopholes of your mobile application. Static application security testing can investigate the application before the code is compiled and can discover unauthorized access. Apktool, Cydia, and App track are some of the tools used in static application security testing.

## Prevent Data Leaks 

Mobile users tend to install various apps on their devices without knowing their authenticity. It is important to isolate each app from one another to avoid data leaks. This restricts the malware from accessing sensitive information. The possible way for preventing data leaks are 

* Restrict screen capture
* Watermark malicious files with usernames
* Stop copy and paste function
* Restrict users from downloading confidential files.

## Summing up

To summarise, cyber attacks by hackers have become increasingly widespread in recent years. Even the most secure systems can be hacked. As a result, if you are intending to design a mobile application for your business, it is critical to remember that security is the most significant component in protecting your sensitive data from hackers. Consider following the above-mentioned security checklist to avoid losing your data to cybercriminals.

As more people use the internet for many purposes, including web searches, having a safe and secure website has become more important than ever. You may think, why would someone hack into a small business’s website, but the truth is small business websites are most vulnerable to cyber-attacks. An unsecured website is always dangerous for you and your website visitors. As a website owner, you need to protect your website from hackers. Fortunately, there are a variety of things you can do to protect your website from cyber-attacks. Below, we will start with some basic steps to secure your website from hackers.

## 1. Use safe and strong passwords:

The first step in safeguarding your website is to create a secure password. All of the websites are password-protected. However, the strength of the password is crucial. Choose a password that is both strong and difficult to guess. A strong and secure password includes a mix of upper and lower case letters, symbols, signs, and numbers. Tools like a password manager can help you create strong and secured passwords.

## 2. Install security plugins

If you built your website with content management systems like WordPress, Magento, Drupal, and Wix, you can improve the website security by installing security plugins. These plugins are capable of protecting your website from cyber-attacks to some extent. Most of the CMS platforms come with free security plugins. Some of the plugins are listed below

* Sucuri security
* iTheme security
* Wordfence security
* Patchstack

## 3. Use HTTPS-SSL certification

HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is a security protocol used to secure websites. The lock icon next to the web address indicates that the site is secured. The site is secured with the SSL certification. SSL certification encrypts the data transfer between the server and the visitor’s browser. This accreditation is required for websites that need payment procedures and sensitive data. Search engines such as Google regard websites that lack SSL certification to be insecure. Secure your website with SSL certification if you want people to trust it.

## 4. Use secure cookies

This feature adds a layer of security between the server and the website visitor. The data information in the encrypted cookies is safer from hackers. Secure cookies may only be transferred via an SSL connection, hence the website must be SSL certified to use them.

## 5. Update your software and website platform regularly:

Updating your software and the operating system keeps your website running smoothly. These updates contain new security patches. Most of the updates require only a system restart and installation process. Website owners mostly ignore these updates, but this is a dangerous practice that can even lead to losing your website. Thus, you should install these updates to secure your entire system.

## 6. Secure your site from SQL injection

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a type of code that manages and allows people to search for information in your site databases. But the (SQL) is often misused by hackers. Hackers insert specific codes into your database to manipulate and steal data from your site. Hackers get in through URL parameters and form fields to damage the databases. This is called an SQL attack. To secure your website from SQL attacks set up parameterized queries and create secure forms.

## 7. Limit user permission and access

A website is nothing but a set of folders and files stored in your web hosting account. These are the files responsible for the proper functioning of the site. Hackers can access these files to steal sensitive data from your website. Limit the user’s permission to read, write and execute any changes in the file. Use a strong and secure password for your account. You can also set security permissions to these files and folders. Ensure every user follows all the preventive security measures before accessing these files and folders.

## 8. Backup your site regularly:

All websites, regardless of size or value, are vulnerable to data theft. In the event of a website hack, the worst-case scenario is losing all of your data. To keep your website safe, make regular backups. If you have a recent backup, recovering your website is significantly easier. You could also consider purchasing an automatic backup solution. The automatic backup mechanism can back up your website without your intervention.

# Conclusion

With the rise in cyber crimes, leaving your website without any protection can destroy site data. Most importantly, recovering your website may cost you a lot of money. So give the most priority to secure your website especially, if you run an online business.

Implement the above steps to secure your website from cyber-attacks and data breaches.

"I’m trying to understand the market a bit for software engineers in the automation industry.
I think my husband is grossly underpaid, but when he talks to his company, they said they have a source of data that gives them what the salary expectation is for their industry for x years of experience.
I think it’s just BS to keep underpaying employees, but what do I know? 
Could anyone please enlighten me in the field?
For comparison, he is has a double major in software and mechanical engineering, and has 7 years of experience in automation, and his current position is senior software engineer, based in Virginia USA.
I have a feeling that he’s grossly underpaid, because of how many years of experience he has as an engineer, and only making 95k/year.
I can’t imagine accountants make more than engineers. I have 6 years of experience, CPA working as an accounting manager for a private company and make 115k plus bonus.

"
The one crucial ingredient underpinning our transition to a digital-first economy, more than any other, is software. That’s why software engineering has become one of the world’s most in-demand professions. In the UK alone, the median salary for the role has increased 13% year-over-year as businesses look to stay ahead of the competition and attract the very best IT talent. But the high salary often isn’t consistent with where software developers stand in the business; many organizations
 still view them as suppliers rather than as crucial players in their success. Based on the current speed of transformation, we know that demand for software engineering is only going to increase. So business and technology leaders need to urgently consider vital cultural changes to help better integrate software development teams within the wider organization. But what exactly should they be?
communication, ways of working and integration between software developers and the wider business. It’s a dilemma that needs immediate attention if businesses are to remain at the competitive edge.

Developers are too often left to deal with huge monolithic pieces of work, which require them to write code for months on end without it being road-tested. This inevitably leads to mistakes that are found only once the updates have already been released to market creating a ripple effect throughout the organization. It’s an all-too-common scenario that demonstrates business leaders’ clear lack of clarity and understanding about the colossal value adopting a DevOps culture can deliver for the wider business, including its customers.

Take financial institutions looking to introduce a new offering, for example, such as a new mortgage product. Without a collective approach to development, getting the backend systems up and running for a product can take up to six months. But modularising the options and breaking down the functionality can shorten timelines to weeks.

Business leaders must look to create unified, cohesive and cross-functional teams that work together on projects that are broken down into simplified and localized components that can be easily integrated together without a negative impact on each other. It might seem like a small strategic change in working practices, but its impact on the speed and efficacy of software development can be enormous.
The role of the software engineer has changed; it is no longer about writing code in isolation without much regard for or knowledge of how it benefits the business. Developers work better when they have clarity about the direct impact their work will have on achieving business goals and on the bottom line. It’s down to business leaders to communicate these challenges and goals (in other words, understand the “why”) to help software developers understand what they’re trying to achieve. But doing so in a way that moves towards a better working culture requires a new approach to building and managing software development teams.

The first step is casting aside the negative stereotypes many have of software engineers and celebrating the intellectual and cultural diversity within their teams. Diversity of personnel brings a diversity of personalities, which is crucial to creating more inclusive cultures that accept and welcome all characters with open arms. While this may seem obvious, what is often overlooked is the impact diversity can have on stimulating and increasing innovation.",Solving the Culture Conundrum in Software Engineering,SoftwareEngineering

"Hi everyone! I'm thinking of developing a (simple) app yet I'm nowhere near knowledgeable enough to tackle it without making several questions,  looking for input, and researching. My friends get together once a week to play a 7v7 soccer/football match yet they always complain that the teams are organized unjustly. I want to help with that with this ""app"".

Each friend would create a **Player** profile that will be given a score by every other **player** after the **Match** is over. The app should take the score of every player, add them, and divide them into two groups of about the same score thus creating two  balanced **Teams**; each team should also be randomized (but I'll tackle that later). The **Group** table is there because my friends could decide to play with other friends and not only between themselves

I wanted to know your opinions on the basic ERD I've put together and if there's anything meaningful I'm missing or any other type of input/suggestion/link-to-info/blogs/books you want to provide that I should be aware of or can make use of.

This is just to know if I'm thinking the structure correctly for when I write the java code.

I'm also thinking about adding a ""leader""/""admin"" role that would have matchmaking privileges inside the group (ie create matches). Should  I also add a **date** as a value of **Match** so that the program knows when to open the registration window to the match? Like it opens on a Sunday and the first 14 **Players** of the **Group** that enter before the **Match** starts can play the **Match**.

"So I just started my first year of software engineering and I'm basically feeling pretty lost with it all.

Programming has always seemed fun to me, but It's been a struggle knowing where to go with it. I've tried messing around with making games in unity on my own time, had some practice with cpp in highschool, and am learning 8086 assembly and C in my lectures now. 

While it's somewhat interesting learning the syntax for each language and learning dry theory upon theory. I'm struggling to see what I could do with it. I would love to try and apply what I learned in practice, but it's incredibly hard to know where to start with it and how to look for information on that.

Guess I'm just impatient with all the theory and I really want to try to work on some sort of project and just make something. Cause it feels like the lectures are going through all the information really slow and I would love to learn more, but I have no clue what that would be and where to start with it.


So I guess I would like to ask for:

   • What topics/concepts I could look into as a beginner that would help get me started 
   • Any online resources that aren't just explaining syntax of a language, but going into how to use it and what I could do with it
   • How you got started with programing, like how did you learn to go from simply knowing the language to making something with it 
   • How to be able to learn on my own

"Maybe let me rephrase the question… Where in the world you can have the highest level of living? 

Of course, Bay Area is notoriously know for high salaries in IT, hitting $500k for senior programmers at FANG companies.
But SF comes also with one of the highest costs of living in the US.
For a decent living which would classify you as a higher middle class you’d need $250k/yr.
New York is a bit more affordable (still very expensive) but the salaries are typically $80-150k based on seniority.

If you work remotely, you can be based on some south-Asian island or in South American and your costs of living can be incomparably lower.
But after some time, you might find yourself lacking the (level of) services you were used, especially health care.

I live in Prague (Central Europe) where average average salary is $17k/yr. (coffee costs ~$2-$3) whilst the salaries in IT are hitting 6 figures!
This sets you for a luxurious live while having all the services and comfort of a mid European capital.
And Prague is fucking beautiful!!
I personally live at Walter Residency (premium living), have a private medical care (www.canadian.cz) with one of the clinics conveniently just before my apartment) and since a dinner in the best restaurant is $35, I don’t need to cook.

I’ve saw many websites such as glassdoor with some numbers I don’t think reflect the current situation.
I work as a Senior Data Scientist at a large consultancy firm and have an equivalent to $80k.
I’m currently open to new opportunities with a 6-figure salary or &gt;$400/MD and I’m getting those offers.
Also, the job listings I see online (such as NoFluffJobs) are often 6-figures.

I was wondering if anybody had a similar type of unusual background and wanted to see how difficult it was to switch careers. I am especially interested in anyone that came from the civil engineering world and switched to software engineering. 

I am thinking because of my education, I can possibly work on coding myself, maybe do a coding bootcamp and make the switch with that. Am I being naive? Is there something else I should do to ready myself for this career switch?",Civil Engineer moving to Software Engineering,SoftwareEngineering

"Hello

I have implemented basic RabbitMQ message sending and receiving on my SpringBoot application, however I am unsure if this can actually be used for mail between 2 users and it feels more like it should be used for notifications?

If this is the case, I have a message sender implemented that will send a message /mail from the sender to the listener. However, I don't understand how I can actually then access the queue for each user and send them the message as an API response.

u/PostMapping(""/send-message"")  
public ResponseEntity&lt;?&gt; sendMessage(@RequestBody final MessagingRequest sendMessageRequest) {  
rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend("""", ""user-mail"", sendMessageRequest);  
return ResponseEntity.ok(null);  
}

Service:

u/RabbitListener(queues = {""q.user-mail""})  
public void onUserSendMail(MessagingRequest event) {  
log.info(""User mail Event Received: {}"", event);  
rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend(""x.post-send-message"", """", event);  
}

Like for each user how do I check the g.user-mail queue constantly to look for messages on the queue and then access those messages and send them to the user?

It is a REST API, not a self-contained application.

Today I saw some quick fixes in the code and I suggested something better in my opinion. That's the problem. Even showing them some benefits of another approach they still think it is my way to code instead of thinking outside of the box.

I'm a senior SE and tech lead, currently 6 months into a role with a startup.

I had an absolutely awful manager who required a lot of upward management in order to protect the team and product, and who is no longer with the company.

The experience was stressful, but valuable, and people might benefit from hearing about it since everyone has to deal with bad management at some point. So, I'd like to share the experience through some sort of write-up.

"Fellow software engineers of Reddit, I want to pick your brains on a couple of things RE onboarding/joining a new development team, writing/reading architectural documentation, and creating diagrams.

1. How much of your time did you spend going through architecture documents, diagrams, etc. when onboarding to a new team? How helpful were the diagrams? If you ever had to make any docs/diagrams specifically for onboarding, how much time did it typically take you?

2. How much time do you spend creating design and other software related documents that exist outside of the core code/codebase? How often does this include making diagrams and how much time does the diagramming process typically take? What software do you use to create diagrams?

3. If you do not frequently create diagrams for documents, is it because it simply wouldn’t be useful or because it takes too much effort but would be useful?

4. How much time do you spend reading documentation created by others? Do you find diagrams noticeably improved your understanding/the efficacy of the document?

5. Where and how do you save and maintain diagrams e.g. embedded in your code repository or in docs external to it?

I personally find diagrams extremely useful when trying to understand software architectures. However, I also find making them to be quite painful even with Lucidchart or draw.io.

"Hey all,

Currently, I am a product manager looking after mobile apps. Before that, I was a data engineer in a BI team.

I had a really tough time debugging my code and that used to add a level of frustration during those days.

Everyone has a different style of learning, my preferred style is visualization. I always longed for an ideal tool that could:

* Actually store/log the event payloads at every step so I don't have to re-run it again. Someone could suggest debuggers/step points but in my case, I had to download the data from a third-party service, then perform intensive data cleaning operations, etc.
* allow me to choose and run a code snippet from anywhere in the repo in an isolated environment so I could check individual functions using the logged data.
* bring a level of visualization and transparency such that everyone can view and identify the problems(or at least improve efficiency).
* log failed payloads automatically so we dont have to implement logging during development

Now since i am a product manager, i am again facing a kind of frustration when our engineers couldn't reproduce a bug at their end and we have to wait for days and sometimes weeks. I think this problem is not just limited to app development or backend development (correct me if i am wrong).

"Hey all. Our team has been looking for tools for creating diagrams for our daily back-end engineering needs, such as tools for creating DB diagrams, high-level architecture / system designs, APIs and its contracts, etc.

We've been using quite a few web-based tools overall such as **Miro**, **Notion**, **Excalidraw**, **Diagrams.net** (former draw.io) and **dbdiagram.io**, and also **OpenAPI** for documenting our BFFs APIs.

Our main problem is that only OpenAPI is actually version-controlled and easy to share with our team, as it is located in the same Git repo as our actual APIs. It is version-controlled and shared by nature, as the code must be pushed to our repository.

Some of those tools also have sharing enabled through Google Drive, but its terribly wonky and most of our team would rather just take a screenshot of the diagrams than going through the hideous process of sharing their stuff. If that person leaves the company, we have to either recreate their diagrams from zero or just forget about it.

So we're basically looking for tools for:

* Relational DB schemas
* System design and high-level architecture
* Other similar use-cases

...that are:

* Version controlled (preferably through Git)
* Easy to share or shared by nature
* Group of people (company) has the ""ownership"" instead of relying on a single person
* (Optionally) Naturally generated or have the option to be exported as SVG (or even some proprietary text-based format)
* (Optionally) Do not rely on a single language or stack to work, as we work with multiple languages

Our first option was using **Notion with Mermaid** or similar since we already have a company-wide Notion workspace, but I'm worried about the learning curve, Mermaid verbosity and the weird Notion version control.

Do you guys have any recommendations? Thanks in advance","Looking for ""version controlled"" tools for back-end diagrams",SoftwareEngineering

"Is there any software engineering job where quality and craftsmanship are valued above schedule and budget? 

That's the TL;DR. Long post follows:

I've worked in the aerospace industry for over 20 years. I'm passionate about software craftsmanship, clean code, readability, maintainability, attention to detail, and thorough testing. I dig deep into the requirements to really understand the system and all the edge cases. When I work with legacy code, I always make sure to understand it at a deep level, to make sure I'm using it and modifying it as the original designers intended. Because I dive deep into the details, and I'm obsessive about getting things right, it's not uncommon for me to find bugs or design flaws that other people couldn't figure out, or didn't know existed, for literally years. I also often find deficiencies in the requirements, such as edge cases that aren't covered, or just plain old mistakes. 

Of course, this means I'm not a very fast programmer. I can't just crank out code. When someone estimates how long a task will take, it usually takes me twice as long, because I raise a lot of questions that nobody else even thought of, and because I need to really understand what I'm doing before I can implement something. And, this kind of brain work takes a lot of energy, and I find that the older I get, the less energy I have, and it's hard to stay focused for 8 hours a day.

You would think the aerospace industry would be a place where attention to detail and quality are highly valued. However, I've worked on a lot of different projects at several different companies, and I've found that schedule and budget are always the main driving factors. And managers, who are mostly not software literate, just want things done quickly, and don't seem to care at all about quality. It seems to me that low-quality code will cost much more in the long run, when the bugs and deficiencies are found later, after delivery. But most of the managers I've worked with don't see it that way. They all focus on short-term schedules, not long-term quality.

When I ask deep questions, I can't tell you how many times I've been told, ""You don't need to know that"", or ""That's out of scope for your task"". However, the people who tell me that are usually proven wrong when it turns out that the questions I'm asking uncover a bug in the legacy code or a mistake in the requirements. And even when they don't, I know what information I need to know in order to do my job right. So I resent people who try to tell me what I do or don't need to know. Understanding the problem and the domain thoroughly always leads to better code, and it helps me to be much better equipped to handle the next problem in the same area. 

I honestly can't do my job if I don't understand what I'm doing completely. I can't just make a bunch of assumptions and move on - my brain doesn't work that way. And, in my 20+ years on the job, I've come across a lot of really crappy, unprofessional legacy code, which has taught me that the engineers who have come before me are not to be trusted. If some legacy code I'm using hasn't been tested and has no documentation, I can't just assume that it works. Often I don't even know what it's supposed to do, until I really dive into it and write my own tests for it.

Sometimes I think all these things mean I'm better at my job than most people. But more often I think it means I suck at my job. Because nobody seems to appreciate my skills. They just wonder why everything is taking me so long, and they get annoyed at all my questions. And it makes me wonder whether this attention to detail of mine is a skill or a disorder.

I wonder if it's possible to get a job where my kind of obsessive attention to detail is actually valued, and people would appreciate me taking the time to do the job thoroughly, no matter how long it takes. Any thoughts or ideas? Can anyone relate to my experience? Has anyone like me found a job where they're happy?",Does any company/industry actually appreciate software quality?,SoftwareEngineering

"I have a strongly held view that's something I think is obvious - the kind of thing with which no one can argue.  However a few of my colleagues disagree with me, so it's leading me to question myself!  What do you think about the following:

Suppose you are given a json schema and your job is to create big files (several million lines) that contain json that is valid  under that schema.  You must code  in java.  *Which of the following would you do?*

* Use some software to generate an API that lets you create objects that match the schema. After creating an object, use an API method to serialize it to a json string, which will certainly be valid.  If no API generation software exists, write your own custom classes that do this using jackson or gson
* Study the schema to make sure you understand what it requires.  Get the schema creator to give you a big example as a guide.  Then create your json using lots of string operations.  Once you are done, run a validator to ensure that the result is valid in the given schema
* This much better approach ==&gt; .... !

My view is that the first approach is the right one. It's what I've done previously using XML, where we have jaxb for example.   So I don't see how json is any different.",Creating JSON that's valid under a provided schema - best practice?,SoftwareEngineering

"Hello all, 

At the company I currently work for, I am required to produce what is internally called a ""Systems and Functional Specification Document"" (SFS). Based on the samples I have seen, the document comprises details such as what happens on a web page during ""on load"" actions; the document also comprises input elements and ""actions"" provided by the web page — as well as ""data source"" and ""accepted format"" to name a few. 

Would anyone be able to explain the key principles of this document in detail (or point me to helpful material)?

"Hey, I'm curious if anybody has suggestions for useful (open-source ideally) Github metric tools? I've looked a lot online and have found very little for free tools. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for people getting compensated for building good software. I just figured for something as standard as Github and the need for good metrics that there's a decent chance that there'd be some free and useful tools. 

Alternatively, if there are any libraries that make getting useful info out of Github APIs easier...all ears there too. Their APIs are amazing, but honestly I feel overwhelmed by the amount of info in there and find it hard to stitch together the queries that I want on multiple endpoints. Again, seems like somewhere there'd be some libraries for common use cases. 

Some examples of what I'm looking for....

So currently each user will only need 1 image so it makes sense, but wouldn't be flexible in the future if the requirements changed to desiring more images per person. 

I figure it will be easier to retrieve the Image file uploaded to S3 using downloadFromFileName(id) rather than creating a file name during the upload such as {timeStamp()}.{nameoffilebeinguploaded} and then storing that in a column of the User table in the database such as 'S3 Filename'. 

Just using the user's id will mean I don't have to read and write to the database to store image filenames.

"Hi all

I'd like some experiences and suggestions of how people have organised a microservice project in jira and general pointers about approaches.

At work we're building a product with a restful microservices backend, and ideally we want those services to be reusable across other related parts of the business (of course with further development, but with a good foundation that isn't tied too closely to our current project). I've not really worked on developing microservices before, and I think it's fair to say there's not a huge amount of experience in the team in this as well. We own all of the services but don't have dedicated teams owning them at the moment.

The project to date has kind of been built top down - frontend is built and the other components (backend/s and a backend-for-frontend) are built alongside. Organising the testing has been a bit of a nightmare as the backends have little requirements other than ""make the frontend stuff work"" and we keep hitting hurdles and keep re-discussing ways to make this better.

If you think of the backend services like products themselves they should have their own requirements, a well-defined API design (at least at some level) and tests around that (including some integration tests between them and interacting systems) and should allow us to test more thoroughly and faster than if we tested through the whole stack. But this is an extra overhead of course.

On the other hand some are suggesting just building them to serve our current application and test the whole stack which seems like it will be a lot of testing at a higher level and we're bound to have gaps and potentially flimsy services. At this point it seems like the ""distributed monolith"" trap.

There has been a lot of debate too about how to organise this in jira. Some push for a ticket for the feature and then each layer is a subtask. This makes sense that the parent ticket represents the user story for the functionality, but does cause some issues in measuring progress - say if the frontend is really simple but the backend is actually quite a lot of work, so it might get carried across sprints even though some components are done. Normally I'm fine with this as it's a deliverable in a sprint and if it's not delivered, so be it, but if one component is done that feels like it should be reflected in the sprint's delivery, even if the end-to-end feature isn't finished (i.e. the service has a set of requirements of its own that is a deliverable, a consuming application can use this API to achieve something).

On the other hand, some want to have a ticket for each layer so we can track what's been developed and who by, but the requirements are always a bit thin on the ground, because it's essentially ""make the website do the thing"".

Anyway we've been talking back and forth for ages and as always there are time pressures and I'd love some insights from you helpful folks and your experiences :)",Organising a microservice project,SoftwareEngineering

Why am I writing unit tests for some crud application. I'm pulling data from some database, putting them into a model, doing are few sorts, maybe a few filters. The code is the simplest thing in the world. Take from database, filter by Id, return said object.

"I am curious what everyone's thoughts are around measuring developer productivity in an objective manner.  


Building complex software is *hard* and rewarding Software Engineers based on their impact is paramount to maintain a meritocracy vs. a socialist corporate environment where the latter will most likely lead to stagnation.  


What are everyone's thoughts around combining a **subjective** review + an ""**objective**"" one.  For example:  


""Bill is super easy to work with, always on time in meetings, listens clearly and has great communication skills""  


and for an objective take, maybe we measure the number of user stories assigned, closed, number of commits written, number of lines of code added, removed, and updated.   


Also we can measure the number of bugs generated and also the number of bugs fixed that weren't necessarily created by Bill's code.

"Hello

I am developing an app using Flutter, but I have decided to create a separate REST API using SpringBoot that the Flutter app communicates with. 

User touches a button -&gt; app asks user's permission to access location data -&gt; app sends POST request with the latitude, longitude and id of the user -&gt; API somehow finds other users that are nearby -&gt; returns JSON DTO representing list of nearby users.

I was thinking of achieving this by having the API return a sorted list of Location objects with a userID, longitude and latitude property based on proximity. However, the only method to do this I can think of would be configuring the Location class to be an entity and saving it to the database every time it is updated, meaning that other user's locations will be available to the API via the database. However, this would perform poorly.

Maybe I could change the above so that when Flutter attempts to get the user's location, it also gets the location of all other users and sends them as a list in the POST request? But that would probably be even more unoptimized?

I have heard of caching before but I wonder if it could be used in this context so when users click the button it stores the location in some temporary data structure in the Flutter app, and then when a user clicks the button it only gets the current users location, adds it to this 'cache' and then sends the cache with the POST request?

There has to be a better way of doing this, any advice would be appreciated, thanks!",What methods available are there for temporarily storing user's locations that update continuously and frequently?,SoftwareEngineering

"​​Hi all, I am not a very experienced developer but am working on delivering an application for a client that revolves around sending sms notifications to pharmacies. I am mainly looking for some insight and feedback on scalability implications and what could be some ways to address them or what to look out for.  Would like to plan ahead and get some feedback before I start coding this up.

I plan to build the frontend with React and the backend with Ruby on Rails with a Postgres DB. Looking to deploy the app on Heroku.

The app will facilitate communication between patients and pharmacies.  Goal is to have a public app that any patient has access to and submits a request for some medication. Then, every pharmacy that is enrolled in the app (admin will enroll them) will receive an sms that patient x needs y medication with z quantity.  The pharmacy will then either respond back to the request if they have the medication in stock or decide not to respond if medication is not in stock.

I will be using two main models:

\-&gt; Pharmacy model with phone number as a string attribute

\-&gt; request model with medication name, medication strength, and phoneNumber of patient making request. All string attributes.

I will be using the Twilio API to handle outbound and inbound sms.  Here is my plan:

1. When patient submits a request on the app (with their phone number included), make a request to my backend api endpoint and I will use Twilio API to send an sms to every pharmacy in my db.  At max enrollment, I could have **1000 pharmacies**.  Luckily, Twilio has some nice built in features for sending sms at this scale while circumventing api rate limits and carrier filtering.

2. If a pharmacy has the med in stock, they will be prompted to respond with the request number (plan to use the primary key here) that will be included with each sms.  Twilio uses a webhook url that I can configure to send to my backend.  My plan here was to make a query to find the request based on the request number (or primary id) sent back by the pharmacy.  Once I find the request, I can then send an sms to the phone number(patient) associated with the request.

I guess what I am not too experienced in is scalability and am not sure what to expect specifically on the second part of the process.  In the worst case, all 1000 pharmacies have the medication in stock (probably would never happen) and I will be getting 1000 messages sent to my backend within a short time frame, all while making a query for each message to my db to find the associated request and phone number of the patient.

Thoughts? Areas of improvement? Things to look out for?

I would appreciate any and all feedback!  Thank you.",Looking for feedback/insight on a rails application I'm building using Twilio API,SoftwareEngineering

One positive thing is about the rapid growth Web3 has right now. I think as an SWE, this invites a lot of technical challenges even if I am not a blockchain dev.

In my team, developers uses mocks like crazy (I think too much, thus I'm asking here).

Whenever there's a service which accepts dependencies via constructor, my team folks are trying to unit test it, by mocking all it's dependencies. If service accepts 4 dependencies (repositoryA, repositoryB, logger, another service) they are creating 4 mocks and UnitTest this service.

I claim however that it's a smell. Maybe this shouldn't be UnitTested at all, and be tested with real dependencies, and then it would become an integration test by definition.

What do you think? Where is reasonable limit of using mocks for unit testing?

Edit:
After few responses which guided me towards ""classicists vs mockists"" topic, I realized that there's no single answer for my original post, but 2 different approaches. I'm leaning toward classicists though. Thanks for all the help 🙂",Should you unit test services and mock all its dependencies?,SoftwareEngineering

"I work for a company that is losing business because they never paid down their technical debt and they are now paying the price. I brought up that the software can longer support what they and the customer want/need and I’m my opinion we’ll be out of business or bought within the year. The only way out of the hole is to stop adding to the big ball of mud and start fresh. Has anyone been able to convince their leadership team that it’s time for a rewrite? If so, how?

EDIT: so additional context based on some of the comments (which have been greatly appreciated and informative).  The code base is &gt; 15 years old.  Part way through, the company pivoted from B2C to B2B but continued to built on top of the original B2C codebase.  Tech debt was never paid down as part of that transition.  10+ years later and we're not fighting our own codebase in order to man-handle and force (bad) code into the app.  The tech debit is so systemic (no clear boundaries, parts of the code know way too much about parts, no clearly defined interfaces, domain separation, etc. etc.) that to attempt to refactor in place is in my mind a non-starter.  At some point the horse is just too sick/old to continue and it's time to put it out of it's misery and get a new horse.  I think most of the problems stem from inexperienced developers never thinking outside the current needs of a feature and didn't take a holistic appraoch to considering what their changes would do to the system and after years of following bad practices we are in the spot we're in.  I don't really care about the historical aspect of any of this.  I'm looking at the mess we have in front of us know and I'm not seeing a ""refactor in place"" as the best path forward.  In my mind we're going to start losing business (existing an new) because leadership doesn't understand how bad things have become.",Convince a company their software is garbage and beyond refactoring,SoftwareEngineering

"Hello all, I'm a designer currently looking into the UX of how various API tools onboards their developer users.

I notice that some API tools, e.g. Stripe, have a simple flow where you 1. sign up; and 2. get dropped into their dashboard with ""Get started!"" CTAs to docs, API keys, etc. Other tools, e.g. Algolia, have more hand-holding in their onboarding flows where you're taken through a step-by-step flow of building your first app.

I'm curious to hear from devs about your experiences onboarding API tools: do you have preferences between simple ""just let me read the docs"" onboarding vs. more handholding ""teach me how to set up an app"" onboarding vs. something else? Does it depend on factors such as your familiarity with the domain (e.g. you onboard Stripe as someone who's built payments before vs. never built payments before), or other factors?

Any insight into developer onboarding for API tools would be very helpful!",Developer onboarding UX for API tools,SoftwareEngineering
"In the application security sphere, there is a lot of conversation about shifting left as a best practice - instead of leaving appsec entirely to the post-deployment phase and depending on white hat hackers or live environment scanning tools, the idea is to take it on as early as possible. Some companies utilise strategies like gating at git to catch vulnerabilities in code before merging, or have dedicated appsec analysts that that are focused entirely on checking for vulnerabilities and threats. 

I am not an expert in this field myself as a UX Designer, but am currently studying these patterns in processes and would like to get a sense of the landscape in the US (while I would like to study this on a global level, my current scope is fixed to this area).

"I have been working as a developer for about 3-4 years. Now that, I have left my job, I want to create monetize a project that I have been working on for a while. What are the different aspects I need to take care of to make my project moneitzable?

Some of the ones that I noted down are as follows:

1. Pin down the target audience and try to create a user experience that caters to that particular audience. In my case, I am targeting engineering and scientific institutes because I am creating a simulation software. In my case, the focus should be on excellent visualization of the problem/solution and UI to manipulate the problem.
2. Secondly, I need to focus on how to distribute it. I am thinking to distribute as a desktop application. Eventually, I also need to parallelize the application to improve the scalability of the application.

Hello!

I'm making an game engine for my graphics programming course with the intent of having a better understanding of game engines work as well as using this for future projects to learn different areas that interest me. (Physics, Animations, Shader Graphs etc.). Building on top of this ""Engine"" as I learn new stuff.

Right now I'm at the part of handling the editors UI (Scene Hierarchy window, viewport etc.) for this I'm using ImGui and my engine is all C++.

I have been trying to think of solutions to render the UI in my editor. I have seen some code on github with a super UI class where which function is a UI element and it has a update function that renders all of them but that gets very messy quickly also terrible scalability.

I though of simple dividing my UI into classes and then render it, SceneHierchy, ViewPort class etc.

But my UI elements needs to often communicate with each other or even parts of the engine making the implementation a bit messy.

Those elements could derive from virtual class (Interface) and just have some virtual update/render method that I could call. But then I would lose a lot of functionality that I need from those UI elements and such.

"Hello, so I landed my first job out of college at a FAANG company. I have been there for 6 weeks. So far I was given one very small bug fix task which was easy. Now I was given a much bigger task that requires knowing a decent amount of the codebase and requires knowing a new testing framework we are trying to migrate to. I have been stuck on this task for 2 weeks making minimal progress. I simply don't understand how this framework works enough, and how our codebase works to complete the task. I have reached to my teammates for help but it hasn't helped much, aside from setting up my environment. I am feeling really stressed since they want this task finished asap and I don't think I will be able to deliver. It is also my first large task and I feel like I failed by not completing it. I don't know what to do. I would have preferred to have had a few more smaller tasks prior to this one. This task is equivalent to one week of work time for a regular person on our team.",New Software Engineer at a FAANG company feeling lost.,SoftwareEngineering
"Hi, student here in the final year of my aero engineering degree. For my final year project, I am looking at the topic of software assurance in aerospace applications. To my understanding, there are prescribed processes (do-178b/c, do-278) by which the majority of airborne software packages are certified. As software becomes even more prevalent in today’s flight control and augmentation systems, I was thinking of researching how appropriate the current assurance processes are, and how could they be improved.

I would be interested to hear if anyone knows of any alternative potential research topics along similar lines. Which areas stand out to you as needing research? I have always been interested in the field of aviation safety and would be keen to hear some suggestions!

"An API apparently lets programs interface with each other that are written and work in different languages. So the REST API I think lets you communicate your front-end of the website in JS talk with the back-end written in python or PHP or JS. 

So if I'm correct, in the above case you are using the REST API. But you are not creating your own API right? What do people mean by that? Do they just mean interfacing two entities by creating some classes which abstracts the communication? 

I am getting my car's ECU to talk with my computer and send ECU data to my computer. I am using the pyOBD library to connect to the ECU and read stuff from it like print(connection.read(speed))

"Hello there. Almost 3 months ago I started to work while engaging vacational education at my favorite Company (thats 3 years of half working and half studying before getting a job contract) and I like it a lot until now, but there is one thing that bothers me.

So, usually companies take inexperienced or junior software engineers for a vacational education, in my case, my colleague and me both have experience in programming, so they gave us real projects right away, instead of teaching.

I don't want to talk bad about anyone, but it seems like my colleague is ""gifted"" in coding, while being average or less in everything else (maths, social skills, plan management, understanding tasks, etc). Meanwhile, I am not that talented in programming, but I have another skills aside that, like being very good in maths, logical reasoning, understanding concepts etc.

The more time goes on, the more I lose self-confidence, since he finishes the projects very fast and I start asking myself if I really deserve this place.
I am trying to improve also another skills aside programming in my free time, like oratory, cyber security, testing, etc., since I think that they will be essential for me in the future, but I am not sure if it is right. 

Now that you know the situation, I would like to know if I am on the right track and shouldn't focus on my colleague's workflow. From my knowledge, programming is only one skill out of the bunch of skills that a software engineer has to pursue, but I may be wrong and also I am afraid to speak with my team manager about this.

"Hey reddit,  
maybe you can help, where I s(t)uck:  
**TL;DR:** I started coding 2001, since 2004 I did some bigger projects as freelancer (car manufacturer), went back to university 2012 to finish with a Master degree in 2017 - besides several jobs. Got some experience as full time employee, but it is not enough to get even a small promotion.   
What is required to be a senior or at least not a junior anymore?

**More details:**

However, since 2017 I never got offered anything better than a junior position. My grades are one of the best in my year, I even ""carried"" some fellow students - they barley passed but are working as software architects right now - triggering intensifies. 

Since 2017 I worked closely with seven (!) newbies in the team, who all got promoted meanwhile. I am not unsocial - people ask me to have lunch with me and we meet sometimes after work. I do most of the time, what is the best for the product and team (I have a strong opinion on code quality...).  

2018 and 2019 I lead two teams in a side project, which ended in a commission for several million Euros.

Asking for a promotion my superiors tell me, that I am not ready. They won't tell me, what is required, because: ""it's part of the process to figure it out"". It's not certificates... From Scrum master to Google PCA it was not enough.

So I thought: Okay, maybe it is my company, let's check other employers: I got several job interviews. It was never required to solve logic puzzles or to do whiteboard coding. But still: Junior is the best they could offer me. One company split the interviews: HR did one part, the other was done by possible future colleagues. They were also surprised that I was ""going"" for a junior position.

Meanwhile I went back to university again and started my PhD. Yesterday I saw on LinkedIn that one of my former fellow students starts at Google (barley got a bachelor, I helped him many days with his thesis and project).

Though it is not important at the moment (because research is my new love), it triggers me hard. Statistic tells me, I am just an idiot. My projects tell me the opposite.

"hello, i am second year computer science student, to day my professor asked me to post and ask developers and students what is the definition of software engineering in your opinion.


and he wants to know what do you think about this definition:
It is the study and use of different methodologies in preparing and maintaining quality software at appropriate time and costs.


the translation it might be a bit off i tried my best to translate it .

"20 years ago, SWE doctrine said structure your solution correctly the first time, so it doesn't devolve into spaghetti.

More recently some people have advocated, code the simplest solution that will work for the immediate requirements on its behavior. If the requirements change and something deeper is needed, you can always refactor, this camp says.

A way to view ""correct"" with respect to the old doctrine, is to say that whatever computer ""science"" concept seems relevant to the category of problems into which your problem falls, reify.

For example, right now, I am looking at a little project to code for a process that will react to user actions by updating a display. The user gets to populate a data structure of parameters to the problem, using either interactive editing with widgets, or reloading arguments previously saved. The system always judges whether the arguments are valid for execution and when they are not, informs the user exactly why. Otherwise, execution happens and output from it is shown.

The ""code the simplest solution that will work"" approach would say to lay down editor code for the components, have it render to the screen the widgets for editing, accept and interpret the commands from the human operator, and also validate. So, concrete editing and validation, which are two separate concerns from a computer ""science"" or traditional SWE viewpoint, are intermingled in the same module for each aspect of the input parameters for a run.

The traditional teaching would say, no, no, no, you don't let those things mingle; that's spaghetti and it's going to tangle you up later. Write one whole module to **model** the data structure and validation constraints, and a separate module for the concrete realization of a particular editor with its widget appearance and the command language it accepts. The concrete editor would communicate with the data structure and validation model and say, OK, the user wants to set this field to a 3, and the model would say back, OK, I'm updating it, but it's invalid for execution because 2 is the maximum permitted value. The editor would relay this information to the user. A solution like this requires loading much more code, because it has to include the communication protocol between these two modules, a complication that is unnecessary if the validation concern and the concrete-editing concern are intermingled in a single module.

"I absolutely love architecture and system design. I excelled at it on my uni course. But every architect position only seems to want people who are already software architects. I no longer qualify as a graduate. I had to take whatever job came along because I spent over six months looking for work. I ended up in a testing role, which I hated. I left that job after a few years and went for a generic software engineer post. At first I was told they wanted me for architecture and design, but then covid hit and we decided that it would be better to hold off until we could meet in person. In that time, I've fallen into a hole that needed filled... in testing. 

When I filled this hole, I was still hopeful that I could go on to architecture once we were allowed back in the office, but I don't think it's possible. I wasn't made aware that filling the testing hole would mean closing that door.

"It is a bit of a weird situation because the company that I work for bills itself as a technology consulting firm, but the owner actually knows nothing about technology.

They're background is in staffing and that is basically what the situation is - they are a business person who gets clients and they then hire tech people to create software products.

The weird part is that they have the final say on decisions they literally know absolutely nothing about.

Cut to the current situation, I recently starting doing engineering for them (good pay, remote work) and the software was absolutely riddled with bugs. They had someone working part-time who was doing it as like a side, fun project (and getting paid peanuts) meanwhile this business person has been charging the client top dollar.

My timesheet says bug fixes all over it because that is what I've been doing. Yet this person is adamant we cannot speak of bugs. ""They pay software engineers to make bugs, and then pay them to fix bugs."" Are their words.

I don't think it is a coincidence that this product was completely filled with bugs - some of which impacted basic, core functionality in production that was completely broken considering their attitude towards bugs like they should never be spoken of.

I wanna check whether the user has permission to download that content. Therefore I've used Access controller component. Access controller takes information of user from the database and it takes content from the database. After that it provides content to the user. That's how I've read this.

*Is there any better way to do this?*

*Also can I leave provided interface without connecting to any required interface (like in Access controller. That is the content provided to the user after checking permission)?*

"When you sign a contract in Canada, there is a clause for no overtime pay. 

What that means is that if there is a bug or an outage with the system you support, you'll be working as long as you need to fix it. Even if that means you'll be spending your weekends and late nights. Missing family dinners and kids' practices.  


That's the status quo in software development. The assumption is that something will go wrong. There is technical debt, third-party libraries, third-party integrations. With so many moving pieces, a lot can go wrong. That's why every company needs to implement as many safety nets as it can. Unit testing, integration testing, automation, manual QA.  


All of them are fantastic. And all of them assume you know what can break. But in many cases, you don't know that. And your team will end up working through weekends and burning the midnight oil.

"I visited the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) yesterday, near Cape Canaveral, Florida. KSC is the primary launch center for many of the US space missions (think Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Space Shuttle). We watched several highlight-reels of long-past (retrofitting the Redstone rocket from a ballistic missile to a crewed space booster), and recently-past missions (Skylab and Space Shuttle). A consistent theme was the sheer number of people and resources that all of these missions consumed. Parallel to that, was the criticality of getting the engineering right, and the high-cost (human and financial) of failure. 

To me the construction of rockets, life-sustaining capsules, and the million other components necessary for space exploration are not completely different from building reliable software. In our day-to-day, we deal with defect escape rates so high that we would never rely on our software to support critical functions like space travel. 

How did the folks at NASA manage to control their bugs well enough to trust their systems through launch and, then, operation at hundreds of thousands of miles distant? 

Did they employ rigorous and very-high-quality architecture and engineering practices? What are some of those? Could we incorporate them into our software engineering construction process?

Was it maintaining detailed and up-to-date architectural documentation? Many of the control room video clips showed mission control engs poring over their Project Binders. 

They mentioned the thorough testing routines. Did they aim for 100% unit and integration (let's add e2e there, too) test coverage? 

My hunch is that there's a mother-load of important engineering techniques used in these enormous, critical, projects that are applicable to our low-risk, average projects. I suspect many of them have already been incorporated into what we consider the present art. But, I suspect even more deeply that we're still far from matching the discipline and low-defect rate acceptable for more established engineering fields. 

What can we learn from launching humans into space? 

(I know few of us in software engineering don't simultaneously double as rocket scientists, so I'm not expecting direct observations from that field. I'm hoping to stimulate a more general discussion on systems engineering and how we could apply more practices from the history of engineering into our software to improve reliability.)",What can we learn about good software engineering from launching rockets into space?,SoftwareEngineering

"I am somehow stuck with my thoughts about an SLA definition, which I plan to determine for a REST-API running on a public cloud.

Imagine having a REST-API service running on Azure which has a database as a dependency. 

To calculate the SLA for the infrastructure part, I would use the following calculation, regarding that the components are serial.

App Service (Component Availability: 99.95%) --&gt; SQL Azure (Component Availability: 99.95%)  = Compound Availability: 99.9%.

But as mentioned at the beginning, I do provide as a service the REST-API for my clients. So looking only at the infrastructure part feels somehow wrong, and I would like to define the availability for the API.

"Our single page application (SPA) aims to allow the user to save a bookmark to a specific point within our application.  The common screen lay out would first be an information category, which presents a grid of multiple rows of data on the left, then a set of tabs on the right, each with either forms and/or additional grids of rows.  The objective is to set a URL which represents the category, the selected row on the left, the selected tab, and the selected field and/or row on the right.

We have looked at the HTML5 History API implementation as mechanism for setting and navigation between UI components, by appending a hash (#) value after the base URI which contains the information to select the proper subcomponents.  The information would be element IDs with row IDs for grids, element IDs for tabs, and element IDs for form components.  We would have delimiters for parsing to facilitate the drill down.

A URL would look something like this... [https://ourSPA.com/app#stand,parts=7,screws,types=2,quantity](https://ourSPA.com/app#green,parts=7,screws,list=2,quantity)

Where ""stand"" is the category, ""parts"" is the ID of the left grid, ""7"" is the ID of the row selected in the left grid, ""screws"" is the ID of the active tab, ""types"" is the ID of the right grid contained in the screws tab, ""2"" is the ID of the row selected in the right grid, and ""quantity"" is the form field which has focus.

"Hi r/SoftwareEngineering!

I'm curious what your development database environment looks like?

I noticed [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/n6eged/do_you_prefer_shared_database_or_local_when/) in r/Database which revealed quite a few folks using shared development databases, whereas some clearly prefer their own local copies.

I wonder if this community has different opinions?

I must admit I was a bit surprised to see as many responses about using shared environments. I've heard from others (and experienced myself) that these shared instances can easily end up changing beneath your feet without you realising and causing all sorts of problems. Schema changes getting applied that conflict with your own, data disappearing or changing unexpectedly, etc. How prevalent are these in your day-to-day?

My other questions for those of you who do use a **local environment** is how is it set up?

* Is it running in a container via something like Docker?
* Is it your own instance in a cloud hosted environment?
* Have you installed the engine itself as a native service on your machine?
* Is it setup entirely differently?
* How large is it? Is it a copy of production? Generated test data?

I'd love to understand where things are in terms of dev db environments across the community, and what you consider as ""best practice""!",What does your development database environment look like?,SoftwareEngineering

"I have seen this problem in a couple of projects/companies I was part of:

First when you start the project you setup a staging and a production system and everything works fine. You develop your feature on your local machine, push it to staging, the product owner (or whoever) tests it on staging and if everything is fine, it is deployed to production.

If the team is getting bigger and bigger it happens more often that one developer deploys feature A on staging and developer wants to deploy feature B to staging. But she can not deploy it because it takes some time for feature A being tested/reviewed. 

So staging is occupied by one feature which suspends the development of another feature.

In our projects we than either build a second staging system called ""preview"" or ""demo"". Which solved the problem for a while, but if you grow more you will get the same problem. 

Or one time on of our developers tried to create a ""lab"" infrastructure where every branch would get its own running system. After 8 months of work the lab infrastructure still was not working like we wanted it (because often other things became more important and work on ""lab"" was postponed a lot) we gave up on the lab infrastructure. We killed it.

How do you manage this kind of development infrastructure? How do you give your developers the ability to have a running demo environment of her branch to do quality assurance or show to stakeholders?

(For context: I am not using serverless or other fancy new stuff. I am mostly working on classic web applications that have grown over at least 5 years and have a backend running an API and a frontend that talks to the API over HTTP (and also some asynchronous worker processes on the backend for long running stuff)

"**TL**;**DR:** How do you structure the transactional messages (email, sms, etc) sending service in your software?

&amp;#x200B;

How do you handle sending messages in your system (emails, sms’s, whatsapp, telegram, etc) to your clients? I already have the necessary apis integrated, I’m wondering how to build the system so it’s flexible and scalable. 

What I'm looking for are personal experiences about dealing with more complex messages systems, dealing with 100+ messages templates that are constantly being changed by the marketing department.

Where would be a good place to store the templates? (we have most of them in .html and .txt files inside the ""server build"" and some in the database). Would an Aws s3 bucket be a better place?

And how to schedule messages after X time? For example, a patient has an appointment after 7 days and 3 hours. We are using Aws sqs queues but it doesn't work very well, and the only alternative I can think involves a database table and a cron job which might be even worse.

How to structure the code? For example, right now we have a cron called BirthdayJob that calls

`TouchpointGateway.sendBirthdayMessage(Patient patient)`

`{`

`EmailService.sendBirthday(patient);`

`SmsService.sendBirthday(patient);`

`WhatsApp.sendBirthday(patient);`

`}`

And inside each service we build the according template and pass it to the according  sender service. (SendEmail, SendSms, SendWhatsapp)","How to deal with transactional messages? (email, sms, whatsapp)",SoftwareEngineering

 *My Hypothesis*. I don't know too much, but with what I think I know, I would assume if such a program or service has an API then it would make it easier to do tasks that are available with such an API. As for very specific actions, I'd have to manually code a way in?

"In my Uni, we are learning about architectural patterns, and were discussing a banking ATM system in which instead of a card, the person uses a fingerprint and pin code for account verification/logging in.

Usually, from what the professor has taught us, I believe that the client-server pattern is used in these kinds of systems(specifically ATMs)? However, we have studied broker system and for this particular system I was wondering that the broker system seemed to be more accurate?

From what I thought, there are three different kinds of servers that the bank needs: fingerprint authentication, pin code authentication, and banking database information retrieval and update. The remaining requirements could be handled locally at the ATM itself. The pin code authentication and bank database servers would already be in place. All that is needed to be introduced is the fingerprint server and the broker. The broker would direct requests from the ATM machine to the appropriate server.

Am I correct in thinking this way? Additionally, what are the differences, if so, between the broker system and the client server system? I am still a it confused between the two as they seem to be quite similar.",Broker vs Server-client architectural pattern,SoftwareEngineering

"I am building a tool that allows you to plug in add-ons. To do so, all you have to do is to provide one ""top level"" class. I will call it ""TopLevel"" since it's the one that will be accessible to the rest of the code. One example of a plug in would have this structure:

Top Level

Second Level 1

some data

Second Level 2

some data

This structure can be anything, really. I simply care for the data inside, how you structure it is up to you.

How should I design the ""Top layer"" so that I can access it with my code while still giving others the flexibility to structure anything below it however they want to? Is there a kind of design pattern or a better way to do this?

I am a college student who has to study software design this term. I am pretty new to software design but admire its power a lot.

I really want to study software design, but every time I show my class diagrams to my teacher, he always tells me that my class diagram was wrong without showing any reasons.

I really want to improve this skill to draw class diagram and other diagrams, but can't depend on my current teacher.

"# Are there any public libraries that replace native APIs in JavaScript or Java?

I was talking to a friend and he raised an argument that all libraries depend on native APIs. It doesn't make sense to me. Sometimes language providers will deprecate existing APIs or their behavior is too quirky to work with so developers build libraries that fix or extend these APIs.

**Edit for rephrasing:**

Would  it make sense to build a completely custom API from scratch instead of depending on and extending existing native ones? If so, what could the use case be?

"Hey,

Sorry in advance if this post is all over the place.I'll break it into points, so I can explain it as clearly as possible.

# My background

I've been programming for 13 years, out of which 3 were commercial (employment, contracts) - the rest were on and off freelance or opensource work.I'm currently employed as a mid-tier software engineer specializing in .NET, Vue, and GraphQL - but **I was also told I'll be promoted to senior engineer** by the end of the year, as soon as I gain more insight into the products we're building.

# The issue

Now, here's the issue - **because I'll be a senior engineer,** I'll be more hands-on when it comes to architecture. In fact, it was made clear to me that a few of the projects will be started and led by me, **so knowledge about proper design patterns and architecture could be a great benefit.**

Because of all that, I've started reading up on DDD, CQRS, Microservices, CAP Theorem, and all the related.. - and while **I understand the premise, I can't apply them to my projects.**

I've had no issue building microservices in the past and I realize they require at least basic knowledge of DDD and CQRS to successfully define bounding contexts and implement communication between services - but I've always done it by intuition (it just felt ""right"").

.. but now, when I'm trying to work on my own relatively simple microservices project and try to apply DDD on the service level (having proper layers: Application, Infrastructure, Domain) - I just get into **the infinite loop** and get to a point where I have a folder structure, get irritated and then start remaking it over and over again - it also doesn't help that I have **OCPD**.

I don't know if it's the right place to ask, but I would greatly benefit from a mentor that I could ask now and then whether my structure or implementation is well within the definition of DDD and/or CQRS.

"Let's say in your frontend user interface, the user interacts with an object (json object) and you need that object to always be in sync with the backend object (stored in the DB)

A straighforward answer would be that whenever the user does a change to that object you have to call your API backend to save it.

But then:

How do you handle the case when saving the object fails? When that happens, the UI and backend are no longer in sync since the change already happened in the UI but not committed to the database.

How do you handle the case where the save doesn't just store the object as it is coming from the frontend but needs to do some modifications to it? When that happens, the changes made in the backend are not in sync with what the user sees in the frontend.

Considered solution:

Have the backend return the object as it is in the database when the save succeeds or fails so that the UI can use that value to revert back the UI state in case of failure or update the UI in case of success.

But this just does sound very clean to me, in case of failure returning the full object doesnt sound like good practice in addition to having to return message errors. And in case of success it feels overkill to have to rerender the whole UI using the updated object whenever a change is made.

"Doing a new warranty registration portal ( web/SMS/ ..BUT mainly IVR phone) for owners to register their new products.

I have proposed that we reverse order the reference number. We have a 16 digit account/reference number we will use for lifetime of the customer ( with other validation / safekeeping of account)

I have asked that this reference number have the most significant digit increasing first .  e.g. 0009, 1009, 2009, ...0109, 1109   .    I think this will speed up IVR and web registration as the most significant changing digits will be read and entered first  -instead of reading a 16 digit number that has rare changing digits every time.

Anyone on team thinks this is strange and surely will cause problems .

To me its a simple improvement that will speed up IVR and customer entry.

"Hey everyone,

Imagine this: a team where you don’t have to hold anybody’s hand. A team that delivers results with you only minimally getting involved in the frontline work.

It's not a dream.

Weeks ago we had an exciting chat with Mike Seavers (ex-CTO at Riot Games) about building self-managed teams. He shared all the tips and tricks you need to know. He’s working hard to implement the lessons he’s learned over the years.  


**Here are some key takeaways from the interview:**

1. What does the manager do in a self-managing team?

The leader’s job is to coach. You don’t do the frontline work anymore, so you shouldn’t make all the frontline decisions. Your job is to teach your direct reports to solve problems and think for themselves.

2. There are reasons not to build an autonomous team

Leaders often have a desire to get to the frontline and do the work. Making decisions for your team is often quicker than having them take time to consider those decisions carefully. However, you come out ahead in the long run by letting these go.

3. Communicate your expectations

Let your reports know that you expect them to think for themselves. You can turn it into a company-wide initiative or you can work individually with certain people. Just be straightforward, and give them space to actually do it.

4. Coach your reports instead of deciding for them

When your reports are making a decision, let them know you expect them to come to you with a suggestion. Help them think it through by reminding them of the goals and pointing out potential flaws. They’ll pick up on the process quickly.

" 

While studying design patterns, I found the following questions in a textbook, and I am having a hard time figuring out the answers.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Re-use an existing class but provide new functionality.**

I believe this could be the Decorator pattern: you can wrap the existing class in another one that provides new functionality.

**2. Be able to replace the implementation of an interface at runtime.**

Here, the ""run-time"" requirement is really giving me a headache. I think this could be the Strategy Design pattern, because it allows for a client to ask the Context which strategy implementation to use. However, the ""run-time replacement"" feels a bit of a stretch here.

**3. Extend the functionality of objects dynamically during runtime.**

Again, the ""runtime"" requirement feels problematic to me. I could argue that the Decorator extends the functionality of objects, and if you have written all the Decorators you need you can pick one of them at run-time.

**4. Decouple clients of a system X from dependencies on subsystems of X.**

This feels like the Bridge pattern, where you split a class into loosely coupled classes.",Appropriate design pattern for four situations,SoftwareEngineering

When I had to do the commit, I first committed, and then I pulled, and boom I had a merge conflict. Most of the time, I have no idea how to solve merge conflicts.

"For context, I am a Senior Software Engineer at a Fortune 50 company and have roughly 5 years of experience, primarily with backend API development. I am quite good at what I do, but have recently started looking at new opportunities. In doing so I have bombed (more or less) 5 coding interviews in a row.

"I've recently changed jobs and currently set up a team of developers to in house solutions previously provided by a couple of freelancers. The current setup was pretty much this: 

* One freelancer was responsible for scraping the data and storing it.
* The other freelancer was responsible for presenting the scraped data in dashboards.

After the initial fact-finding period, I'm pretty clear that both have done their jobs well, but that we are missing:   


* the data transformation and loading you would expect between what are effectively staging tables (full of months worth of data)  
* A middleware to act as a Data Access Layer for the frontend, which instead runs raw queries against SQL. 

I'm making the case for both of the above mostly over the arguments security and performance, I document everything as user stories and technical debt (because we spend $$$ on a database optimized to process the raw data slowly), but I'm having a really hard time getting business leaders to acknowledge that these functions need attention. 

I'm curious what other strategies you all here may have used to communicate the more hidden features. The business seems to think because we have it all running already it cannot take much time, but my current estimate is 4-6 weeks for the ETL process, warehouse setup and a pretty crude API.","How do you manage a Product Owner that sees inputs, outputs but few technical aspects of the system?",SoftwareEngineering

"Just curious if this is possible -- I want to build something that will help me with some Google Docs workflow (non-software engineering production / project) . It's pretty specific to the process\*, I don't feel like signing up for a full featured project management system or something over it. Essentially I'd like to highlight text in Google Docs and tag it -- then be able to browse the text by tag later in a different view (or even a filtered view of the current page).

Does Docs API have a webhook to retrieve a ping when a doc saves? I could use that with an AWS lambda to parse the page for custom tags -- saved to a dynamo db. Then another endpoint that serves html for the tags.

Maybe there's a better way?

"Hello,  
I'm working on a macroservices (sane microservices as people call it) project and I'm having difficulty wrapping my head around an issue related to DDD.  


In a typical DDD project, you would have 3 layers: Application Layer (AL), Domain Layer (DL), and Infrastructure Layer (IL).

According to major sources on DDD - by default, the dependencies should look like this:  


[Dependencies in DDD](https://preview.redd.it/ml34ox2j4iz61.png?width=303&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=219460dfad8c1b8745befafcd3d01919a6325e86)

This makes sense:  
\- AL is usually an API that gets data or spins logic in DL  
\- IL is storage for POCO's contained in DL  
\- DL is just plain business logic.  
Now, the issues I'm having are - I'm using .NET, GraphQL, and Entity Framework Core (EFCore) for this project.

GraphQL allows sorting, filtering, and pagination of records, among with being able to fetch nested (related) entities with ease - provided it's connected to a queryable source, like `IQueryable&lt;TEntity&gt;`.  
This generates the #1 issue I have because it enforces that methods in my DL return `IQueryable&lt;TEntity&gt;` as opposed to my POCO's which aren't queryable.  
So, the dependency chart immediately looks like this:

https://preview.redd.it/cloy4l8y9iz61.png?width=603&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6218f47badca3f24cc5cb2365132134b6e2e80f

EFCore allows putting together multiple queries into a single query - thus reducing simultaneous database calls to one and improving performance greatly.  
This generates the #2 issue I have because it enforces that in order to make use of that feature - I have to write the logic in my methods around EFCore's `DbSet&lt;TEntity&gt;` instead of my POCO's.  
So, in this case, the dependency chart would change to this:  


https://preview.redd.it/hx4o9tmuaiz61.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bb880a145e7ce55357ce14a42afe084585a8c21

In both cases, the shape of DL and its logic has to adhere to AL or IL - which I consider anti-DDD.

" ""It will create a huge mess. What were they thinking?""

The instructions were specific. Copy this column into a new column. If we need a join, then use the new column. Allow the original one to be edited. Reason? Well, because the customer wants it shown in their language.

Trouble was, the original was a primary key. Used for joins all over the code base. Database, services, backend logic, config files... We were looking at enormous maintenance and testing impact.

Whoever had come up with this solution, obviously did not understand this.

Here's the trouble with prescribing a solution like a spec. It's like a one-way hash. It encrypts the customer's needs into software features. But features will not tell you WHY they need it.

Did they really need exactly THIS column to be editable? We pushed back and digged deeper. Turns out no. They just want the frontend to show it in a different language. They did not care which column we use.

When you understand both the customer's needs AND the code base, you'll often end up with slightly different features. And a vastly more efficient implementation.

Inexperienced developers will follow the ""letter of the law"", and make (usually wrong) assumptions about customer needs. And they won't realize the long-term consequences until it's too late.

Experienced engineers will push back with ""why do it THIS way?"". Or, ""this will cause problem X, Y and Z"". They're not being negative. They're doing their job.

In the end, the smarter solution was simply to abstract the DISPLAY of this column into one central piece of code. This logic would then check a second column to see if there was an edit. If yes, display that, otherwise use the original. Primary key left untouched.

HUGE cost saving.

"Hi all, I am a software engineer and I have been working for this big company for 3 years. Last year I changed team and my current manager is very incompetent. I have tried talking to him but it seems that every month he comes with some awful idea that, in my opinion, has the only consequence of breaking teamworking. 

The point of my question is not much about those decisions but about the idea of complaining with his boss. I want to understand how bad this idea is as I can't see how things can go well for me.

Adding a bit of context, my manager is not doing anything illegal or unethical but he is feeding a team culture based on blaming games that can only break thrust within the team and pushing people to leave the team(half of which has joined last year, so turnover is quite huge). My boss's boss works out of the team and I am afraid he is not aware of shit happening. Unfortunately I don't know him, only met a couple of time, seems smart but no idea how he would react.

My idea is to go to my boss's boss and politely inform him about the situation within the team, asking if he is aware about these decisions and what he thinks about them. The obvious situation I am worried about is him agreeing with his decisions, going to reveal my complain plan and breaking my already not great relation with my manager.

"Hey guys, first reddit post here from me. I just want to say if you read all this and take your time to respond, I really appreciate it and any feedback you may have for me. 

I need some guidance on what to do with my career. I graduated from McMaster University (Hamilton, Canada) in April 2022 with a B.Sc in Mathematics and Computer Science (it’s not a double degree, it’s just half math and half computer science courses), I have applied to around 400 jobs since then and have given maybe like 4 interviews throughout this whole time, none of them being successful past the first round. I am currently considering three different options, the first is doing a master’s in Software engineering, the second is doing a 3 to 4 month coding bootcamp, the third is completely changing career paths. 

If I was to do a masters, that would be around 2 more years before I can get a software engineering job, and it’s not like I would be able to “use” the fact that I am currently doing a master’s to my advantage on my resume, as employers don't care if you are currently pursuing a master’s, they want to see if you actually have the masters. Another problem with this route is that a master’s in comp sci / software engineering isn’t really that beneficial as say other fields. For example, typically to get a data science or Machine Learning related job you would need a master’s or PhD, so it would make sense there and it would actually be worth your time and money, but not so much as here in the software engineering field. 

The second option of doing a coding bootcamp doesn't seem so bad, but they are relatively expensive (15k cad on average). For a 3 month program you’re paying 5k per month, which is most people's salary for the month, that's more expensive than university in Canada (my total university program cost was around 40k over 4 years). Another problem is that if I start the bootcamp and I get a job offer, what now? I may have paid a couple thousand dollars into the bootcamp already but now I have finally gotten a job offer, so that couple thousand dollars will essentially be a waste if I were to accept the job offer. Something else relating to the bootcamp is that let’s be honest, nowadays you can learn anything online, and build your own portfolio just through udemy courses. Yes I know that staying consistent without anything there to hold you to account (like the money I would be paying for the coding bootcamp) is extremely difficult, and although 99 % of people think they can do that, only 1% actually can. Two other nitpicks I have with the coding bootcamp is that I am located in Toronto Canada, where jobs are nowhere near as much as they are in the U.S. In the U.S there's a job for everyone, and that includes software engineering jobs - as long as you even have just a degree, some company out there will hire you soley based on that (I know as a Canadian citizen I can apply to jobs in the U.S, but U.S employers really only consider exceptional Canadian candidates since they need to sponsor the individual etc). Also for me to be in debt of my university tuition plus the coding bootcamp tuition and to land a small 65k CAD (49k USD) software engineering job, is it really worth it? I have bills to pay etc, it’s not like I can just pay that debt off in a couple of months with my salary. One last thing about the coding bootcamp(s) is that they are full stack focused, I want to be more on the back end side of things, because I like solving those DS &amp; A  problems (although I am not very good at them, I can barely do the easy ones - but I am keeping at it). And companies usually look for front end only, or back end only engineers when it comes to juniors, full stack engineers are more of a senior position. Fullstack at the junior level is like being a jack of all trades master of none type of thing (maybe I’m wrong though). 

The last option of switching careers, this is honestly only out of desperation if I do end up doing it, but regardless I want a career (whether it is in software or anything else) that allows me to climb up and grow, both in my knowledge and my monetary compensation. I was thinking of something like a sales job, since there are opportunities to grow in that field. But with my computer science degree will they really hire me? I believe they won't, I would need at least a year of customer service experience working in something like Walmart, which in that case wouldn’t it be better just do the bootcamp and if I were to do the master’s degree, I would only have a year left to complete it.

"The subject of coroutines includes, when we want or need to speak in precise, clear and unambiguous terms, a concept of a static artifact of programming, contrasted with a concept of the dynamic runtime structure that embodies the state and carries out or supports the execution. These are analogous to procedures and procedure activations. I asked ChatGPT what terms to use to distinguish these concepts and after some back-and-forth, I settled on ""coroutine"" for the dynamic manifestation and ""coroutine function"" for the static artifact. Are those definitions consistent with your understanding?

Also, comparing ""coroutine"" to terms that are semantically close, like ""coöperating thread"", ""lightweight thread"", looking in W'pedia and consulting ChatGPT, I feel that none of the other terms wants to eat up ""coroutine"" on the grounds of greater familiarity with the other term by software engineers without loss of the precise semantics. Do you agree? Choice of terms can be fraught as it guides the naming of libraries and entry points therein. A wrong choice is hard to undo and can interfere with readability. The coroutine concept I'm thinking of includes these features:

- for purposes of understanding access to shared memory, interrupts are in effect always disabled. A coroutine has to give up control, of its own volition, in order for the scheduler to get control or any other coroutine or the main thread to get control. In some programming languages, this yielding of control can be written as `yield`. In the Apollo Guidance Computer, a special entry point had to be called.

"Hello,

do you (or other people in your team) actually go through a (system) design phase before you start writing code?

All of the companies I've worked for skip the design phase part altogether - can you please tell me how you do it in practice?

Do you create diagrams first, using something like C4 or UML?

Do you also create skeleton code (i.e., signatures for functions and methods) for each module / component?

How do you make sure the devs follow the designs? 

Do you add the diagrams to the repo?

Do you set up the repo so that devs can't modify the skeleton code (i.e., name and parameters for methods / functions) but only add code to the body of those methods / functions?

Is there anything else you do to make the whole thing work?

And then there's a handful of code analysis tools that show you dependencies and things based on the code you actually have already written. But I want to do my design and documentation, management, test coverage, all that in the same tool. (And this is also along the same track as the person who asked about the state of software project management. There's so many processes and pieces of software to help out here and there but with the amount of manual stitching between them, it all falls apart) With all the tools we use to automate stuff, I feel like there ought to be something out there that both auto-gens code from diagrams, and can read your code to create diagrams. You could use it to diagram out your code, flesh it out, and then when you've got it at the high level, move into your IDE to fitness, but then continue to have the same diagrams be regenerated for automatic documentation.

"I've worked at software companies big and small for about a decade and the one common theme I see is they all can do a better job organizing information about the software they build and maintain.

Things like architecture diagrams (high/low level diagrams, UML diagrams etc.), UI flowcharts, documentation, metrics etc. are all scattered across various tools that all do that one thing very well. E.g. metrics are in Splunk, documents are probably in Confluence/G-Docs etc.

But it's hard to know how they all tie together unless you have it ""hardcoded"" in your head. E.g. you must know which dashboard in Splunk surfaces the metrics you're looking for, you must also know which document/runbook in Confluence has the relevant information on how to act on those metrics. And more often than not this documented information, if it exists at all, has drifted from reality i.e. the resources they point to don't exist anymore.

Worse yet, the need for this ""hardcoded"" information is precisely what makes onboarding new hires hard; it's my least favorite part of joining a new team.

At one of my previous employers, we created a ""team page"" on the internal wiki that aggregated the team members' directory links, listed the services we owned, included some basic documentation and embedded metrics via iFrames. But even that didn't meet our needs fully.

" 

Over the past three to four years, our organization has been working to enhance our Agile practices. While this journey has had its ups and downs, it has given us value to be more iterative.

First, I would like to provide some context to better understand the situation. I am part of the IT software development leadership team, and my software engineering teams are all organized into scrum teams, consisting of a Product Owner, Analysts, Scrum Master, Developers, and Quality Assurance specialists. Our sprint cycles are two weeks long. Engineers work on a feature branch and deploy it to a DEV environment where it is tested with other features. The engineers then promote the changes to our QA environment where the QA testers will perform their testing.

One of the recurring challenges brought to my attention is that during the two-week sprint, the developers consume most of the sprint on feature development, leaving limited time towards the end of the sprint for the Quality Assurance team to conduct their testing. I decided to sit in on a grooming session with one of the teams that have these challenges and one of the things I observed was that the PO was grooming tickets with a large number of acceptance criteria (8 - 12 bullet points of criteria for the ticket to be marked as complete). I asked the PO if she could refine that ticket into smaller workable user stories so the developers could deliver smaller features over to QA as soon as they complete the user story's feature.

I have engaged in discussions with several IT stakeholders and the following are some of the outcomes of those discussions. I would be grateful for feedback from others who have selected any of the potential options listed below for their own use and how it has worked out for their scrum teams.

\*\*\* **Option 1 \*\*\***

Implement a Shift-Left Approach for the Quality Assurance (QA) Team. This approach would involve the QA engineer starting the testing process early in the software development cycle, potentially testing in the feature branch or the development environment. As a result, the QA team would not have to wait until the code is promoted to the QA environment. Additionally, the QA team would be working closely with the developers from the outset, potentially assisting in the creation of automated unit tests for the feature.

\*\*\* **Option 2 \*\*\***

Instead of shifting left with option 1, ensure the team is refining the user stories small enough so the developers can work on smaller features (ones that might take only a 1 to 2 days) and quickly promoting those features into the QA environment for QA to begin testing as early as day 3.

\*\*\* **Option 3 \*\*\***

Option 1 &amp; 2 - Refine User Stories and Implement a Shift-Left Approach for the Quality Assurance (QA) Team. The objective of this combined approach is to break down user stories into smaller, manageable features that can be completed within 1 to 2 days by the developers. At the same time, the QA team would start testing the features early in the software development cycle, either directly from the developer's feature branch or in the development environment, rather than waiting for the code to be promoted to the QA environment.

**In Summary**

The only concern with shifting left for us is that I understand that to shift left, you need to practice automated testing as much as possible, and implementing TDD would also be helpful. Otherwise, your QA is going to be spending a lot of time manually validating in several places (feature branch, DEV environment, and the QA environment).",Scrum challenges with Developers and QA.

"I have a few questions about the viability of my login/registration flow.  
Login/Registration flow UI:

1. The user enters their phone number, they are sent a verification code through Twilio.
2. The user enters the verification code and assuming the verification code is correct, the user is either navigated to the home page, or a different page to provide their name and email if they are a new user.
3. If they are a new user, they enter their name and email and then are navigated to the home page.

Login/Registration flow backend:

1. A **non-authorized** endpoint that accepts a phone number as a parameter, requests a verification code text be sent to that number.
2. A **non-authorized** endpoint that accepts a phone number and verification code as a parameter, confirms that the verification code is valid,  and checks if the phone number exists in the Users table. If the phone number exists, then return a JWT (with the user\_id as a claim), and a boolean that says the user is not new. If the phone number does not exist, then Insert the User into the table, and return a JWT (with the new user\_id as a claim), and a boolean that says the user is new.
3. An **authorized** endpoint that accepts no parameters (uses JWT), to update the Users table with the user's name and email.  


Questions:

1. Would it be bad practice to use the INSERT in my Users table as a way to determine if the user is new or not instead of doing a separate SELECT query to check if the phone number exists in my Users table (phone number is a unique constraint)? I imagine I could just catch the duplicate key error that is thrown on the INSERT, instead of doing two separate queries to the DB.
2. Should my endpoint that requests a verification code to a phone number be authorized in some way? I could imagine some outside caller potentially spamming that endpoint to send verification codes to random numbers.
3. If I use a JWT, I shouldn't ever need to pass the User ID as a request parameter right? Or is it bad practice to use the JWT to carry the User ID around?

Hello Reddit Community,

Are you someone who has always been fascinated by the world of software engineering and is looking to start a career in the field, but feels held back by the idea of needing a traditional university degree? Well, I have some great news for you! The world of technology is rapidly evolving, and with it, the way we approach education and career development.

In today's society, we have numerous resources and opportunities to learn and grow our skills, regardless of whether we hold a traditional university degree or not. With the rise of online learning platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and Codecademy, anyone with the drive and determination can learn the skills needed to become a software engineer.

That being said, it's important to note that becoming a software engineer is not an easy feat. It takes time, effort, and a willingness to continuously learn and adapt. But, with hard work and dedication, you can gain the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in this dynamic field.

So, the real question is, do companies hire software engineers without a degree? The answer is yes! While a traditional university degree may be a preferred requirement for some companies, many are open to hiring individuals who have gained their skills through self-study, online courses, or bootcamps. Companies are becoming more focused on the skills and abilities of potential hires rather than just their education background.

"I'm wanting to research the effects of a small team (\~4 developers) or a startup adhering to a rather strict SDLC. It seems like usually large companies have more bureaucracy and it's more difficult for an IC to just ""do something"", like push a new feature. Generally, startups have minimal overhead in this area, and it lends itself at least to the perception of a startup being ""fast-paced"" compared to a Fortune 500 company. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have already read books like Slack, Mythical Man Month, Beautiful Teams, and the Unicorn/Phoenix Project, but I'm trying to find one or more books that focus on the above and contain empirical data that could support/refute the notion that a startup/very small team can ""have its cake and eat it"" when it comes to having significant processes developed (e.g. strict code review, well-flushed-out JIRA tickets, but also still able to iterate rapidly like a startup).","Is it really a bad idea for a small team/startup to have a lot of ""process"" overhead?

"I'm working on a small hobby project and I want to implement proper / rigorous tests. 

I think I understand unit tests. I write unit tests for each function, or for a couple functions at a time if the functions are really tiny (for e.g. modifying a date format and then outputting it somewhere etc.). 

End to end testing seems like I would be testing user flows? (""Log in, navigate to this page, create an entry, go back to the home screen and check for the update""). Is that even correct??

BUT INTEGRATION TESTING??? How the heck do I know what to test? There seem to be dozens of instances where two modules might interact. For example, I might have my API routes defined, call the business logic, which calls on the database layer. Do I check API layer &amp; Service layer, Service layer \* DB layer, DB layer &amp; actual db instance separately (four tests)? What if the API layer uses two different services? Or is it enough to have a one integration test per API route?

Even unit testing a service layer function might call on the database layer. Is this a separate integration test? 

Also I have been storing unit tests next to the referenced code. Where do folks even place integration tests? In a tests directory with its own structure? (Some feature test directory -&gt; multiple test files that involve that feature ?)

I feel like folks with enough experience in the industry might pick up on how far to test / what it feasible / reasonable etc. just by working on large (and hopefully well maintained) code bases. And I'm hoping I can pick your brains because I am really struggling with defining what exactly I should be testing in an integration test.

I've been in my current position for almost 8 months now and it is agonizingly terrible for software development. My title may say ""software developer"", but at 8 months in I've only JUST began writing code, and I could barely call that ""professional experience"". It's evident to me from the work of my tenured colleagues that this company has no future in software development, and I will be stuck working with some of the worst software on this planet (FactoryTalk, RSLogix, the likes) for the remainder of my time here if I don't leave.

I fear for my chances of getting a job in the future and don't want to stay somewhere that is going backwards, so I believe the best time to leave is now.

"Based on the feedback that I got from the community [on the topic of preserving history](https://www.reddit.com/r/SoftwareEngineering/comments/10v5mea/how_to_model_document_history_in_relational/) I'm looking into and learning about event sourcing. 

So far, my plans are to implement a fully relational database backed event sourcing system, without CQRS. In this implementation, I would have an events table with event types and body, and my primary projection would be the read-only data structure that preserves the application state.

This is how I roughly envision this system:

[sql based event sourcing](https://preview.redd.it/yqirxns9f6ha1.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=020bec6406af88f89c239b74424a282472e2593e)

Because the system is not expected to ever exceed 10/req/s I wouldn't introduce any async actions or eventual consistency, but rather do every event update inside of a single transaction. 

For example, this is how a typical controller would function;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;def create(params) do  
&gt;  
&gt;   res = transaction do  
&gt;  
&gt;event = create\_and\_save\_event(params)  
update\_projection(event)  
&gt;  
&gt;end  
     
   if res == :success do  
return http.201  
   else  
return res\_to\_http\_code(res)  
   end  
&gt;  
&gt;end

&amp;#x200B;

What I already anticipate is that uniqueness validation could be tricky, as well as looking up the history of a particular entity (ex. give me all changes for milestone ID=xyz) without storing its ID somewhere on the event.

Anyways, I was reviewing a PR by a developer on our team who's known for his super clean code that always, always works.

"So for starters, I’m in a situation where I’m a tech lead of a software group. What we have to work off of at the point are system requirements, that is very high-level requirements meant to apply to software, hardware, safety, security, test, and other groups working on this project. It’s our responsibility to write software requirements, design documents, and ultimately implement the software for this system.

I think the way we’re doing this currently is wrong, but I’ve been overruled by one of the senior engineers on my team (that in itself is a complicated situation, but not the point of this post). Basically, what we ended up deciding to do was this:

High level design of the software comes first. This is where people draw boxes with arrows and say generally how certain things will interact in software. We’re doing this before requirements because (quote) “how can you write requirements for software if you don’t even know how it’s going to be designed?” This is done only by senior engineers.

After that, requirements are written. This is where we delve into exactly what particular software units need to input and output, as well as what information each data structure needs to contain. This is also the responsibility of senior engineers only. 

After that, we do low-level design. This consists of writing each function out with its parameters and returns, then writing pseudocode for that function. This is finally where the whole team contributes. 

Finally, we implement the low-level design exactly. Until we reach this point, no one has touched a real compiler. 

We’re doing this iteratively in sprints, so all of that happens for small pieces of software in cycles.

The thing is, this seems wrong to me. What I think is this:

Software requirements should precede design, even high-level design. Requirements should be conveying what the software needs to do regardless of how it’s designed.

High-level design should bound the implementation, just as requirements should bound the design. Design should be our attempt at saying, “if we make software like this, all requirements will be met”. 

Low-level design as we do it should not exist. It’s no better than writing code on paper. The code documentation should cover this instead, and developers should be working with real compilers and tests by this point in order to create an implementation that works in the real world rather than in their own heads.

That’s the crux of it. What I want to ask is: Am I off base? If the way we’re doing it now really is better, then I’d appreciate an explanation as to why I’ve got it wrong. If not, then how do I explain/justify that what I’m proposing is a better way to go forward?","Requesting advice on relationship between requirements, design, and implementation",SoftwareEngineering

"Hi everyone,

First of all, sorry for the longer post, I need an advice about my career.
I am 34 years old and I have started my programming journey exactly 1 year ago. Finished bootcamp, done 6 weeks of Leetcode after (80%easy, 20%medium). Then I got my first job (React mostly day to day development). After 6 months at that job I have gone through an extensive interview for a Backend Apprenticeship in another company and accepted the position. I have started in the beginning of the year. Currently in the new position I am asked to learn on my own, with my mentor explicitly being there just to do the overview, which is pick my tasks and making sure that I don’t mess up production environment. For the first 4 weeks, I wrote some code to replace some strings in JS and some Python code for hiding some personal info (Both of tasks ade deployed to prod.).
Now the problem: I am not only learning a new language (Golang), but also a company’s project structure, flow, Redis usage, Aws Lambdas ans Events, writing unit tests, setting up metrics for error checking, and a lot more. I have 6 weeks until the decision is made and I have been told that because of the hiring freeze in the company the expectations are gonna be higher for the conversion to FT BE because it is considered an exception (pre-freeze rate was 80%). My biggest struggle is because I can learn fast when someone shows me something (or explains it) once, but figuring everything on my own takes more time. I feel really stressed although I like the company and the work. I know that for a Backend Engineer expectations are high but is it realistic to learn this much in less than 3 months? Does anyone have any suggestions or advice, should I start applying to other jobs just in case?

"Hello folks,

I'll skip my personal life as much as possible but some details are important to assess the situation.

I dropped out of Uni having given only one exam in years (C programming), and my next focus was taking the Software Eng classes after a buddy of mine taught me what it was about.

I figured that it was the perfect place to start (in the meantime that I'd get the basic Unity certification to learn C# and the program) since I am a perfectionist (which is actually a bad trait) and I tend to have more of a ""planning"" approach than a ""let's do it"" one.

I've read the introduction of ""Software Engineering: Principles and Practice"" by Hans van Vliet along with some more chapters, but I was wondering if there were more ""practical"" books to read to be prepared to face such a big project.

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to have laid out almost all the work before starting to code, as I know that a big architectural change during progress is a big hassle to manage. Given my horrible temper, I know I will take big pauses in between so I'll surely forget the outline of the project, so a well written documentation is necessary to keep myself on track.

"I feel like an idiot.

At work I was tasked with writing a launcher for a bunch of independent linux processes that we are developing. We wanted to support launching them, cleaning up system files that they left hanging around (for various reasons they couldnt clean up after themselves), and searching and modifying config files enmasse. It's a developer convenience thing that would end up on every dev's machine.

We also wanted to support both WSL and remote Linux boxes from a single client. Ultimately I settled on a TCP solution: An agent would run on the remote board, and the launcher would connect to it in a client/server configuration. 

We wanted the launcher to be extensible, so I wrote an XML schema and a parser that allowed us to add new apps to the launcher without changing any code.


The launcher would parse the XML, generate start/stop controls for each app, and then send commands to the agent running on the remote machine who would in turn start and stop them, as well as return status messages about the processes and clean up after them as they start up and shut down.

The problem? The commands were unencrypted plain-text including the locations of binaries on the remote machine, and exact config parameters to run them with. The TCP server would run whatever the connected peer told it to, in whatever folder was passed.

I created a TCP server that could run arbitrary commands received as plaintext on a remote machine, with no login required. All a hacker would need to do is open a wireshark instance, sniff the packets, and then they'd know everything they needed to know to make the target box do essentially whatever they wanted. We were going to configure it as a linux service on our virtual machines, dev boxes, and wsl instances


I spent DAYS writing this before I realized what I did. Luckily I caught myself before it was pushed to the repo and other developers actually started using the dang thing. Maybe it would have been caught in the PR, maybe it wouldnt have, but every WSL instance on every developer's machine could have had the worst possible kind of back door installed on them.


I don't know how I didnt catch this earlier. Neither did anyone else that I showed it to and discussed my design with. Like, I'm happy I caught it, but how did I not see it for what it was before I dang near finished the thing? 

The worst part is that I have cybersecurity training. 

Ugh.

I guess sometimes you don't see the forest for the trees.

I could implement SSL and encrypt it, but even encrypted I hate the idea of an ""Arbitrary Bash Command"" service running on any of our machines, encrypted or not, so I'll probably give up the remote agent component altogether and use an ssh-based solution.","You ever write 2,000-ish lines of Python code before realizing ""OOPS, MY SCRIPT IS A MALICIOUS BACK DOOR!""?",SoftwareEngineering

1. Problem identification phase: Phase one of the problem-solving process involves identifying the software modification requests and giving each one a unique identification number.
2. Problem analysis stage: This stage evaluates each legitimate modification request to ascertain its viability and scope.
3. Design phase: Based on needs provided in earlier phases, developers construct new modules that need to be replaced or modified at this stage.
4. Implementation phase: During the implementation phase, developers adjust the software as a whole and add specifications, new features, and code.
5. System test phase: During this stage, the development/testing team tests how well new modules work with the overall system.
6. Acceptance test phase: During acceptance testing, internal users or a third party specify and run tests on the fully integrated system.
7. Delivery phase: The group distributes updated software to users following a positive outcome from the acceptance testing.

"Since ChatGPT, many articles have been popping up about how AI will replace software engineers and developers. (Maybe not in the near future, but eventually)

1) Reasoning, if AI will be able outperform humans in software development, building amazing application useful for other engineering courses like CAD softwares, then what stops it from replacing other engineers like mechanical, aerospace, etc?

As far as I know if we reach a point that AI is able to automate software engineers, then won’t it as well automate all other engineers? I mean if the AI is smart enough to automate the development of complex applications, then it will also be able to automate the usage of those applications. Maybe it won’t even require to develop those applications and just bridge to output the required engine/design artefacts. It will be able to assemble complex physical process pipelines.

2) What I don’t understand is why will software engineers/computer scientists be replaced before other engineers. Aren’t they necessary to maintain and enhance AI? If we reach an AI able to learn entirely alone this means no other job is safe.

I can’t quite understand why software engineers/computer scientists are the most in danger of losing their jobs. I though computer scientists would be the last jobs to become obsolete if AI excels humans, since they are the brains behind AI advancements.

3) How aren’t careers like lawyers, accountants, physicians, etc more in danger? Those careers can be highly automated as well. Aren’t computer scientists needed to automate them?

4) Also will software engineering/computer science change towards a more AI and interdisciplinary point of view? Or will it remain the same and just become obsolete in the future?

* Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, React and Swift.

Strengths

* Fluency in most of the common data structures and algorithms
* Ability to write clean code and apply design patterns
* Desire to learn new things
* Able to communicate with precise technical terms

-go back to get a second bachelors in CS, and complete the degree in 4-5 years (I’d be 28-29) 

-get a bootcamp certificate and then get a MS in computer science since work experience could test me out of some pre requisite classes

So i'm kind of familiar with how code works but I was refreshing over some java OOP principles and this question came upon me that I cant figure out. So I was watching a youtube video that was talking about Interfaces, now in the video he used a the example of a fitness website. Where the base class was a User, then he had different child classes that would extend the User class (like a Employee, Manager, Customer, etc...), then he made an object of each of those classes in the main method, passing the arguments for the custom constructor and was showing the methods that where available in each object that came from the base class. The question that popped in my head was ""If this java code is backend, and it connects to, lets say a JS front end, and lets also assume that there is code that talks to each end via api or whatever may be. What input could a client (who is using the Fitness website) possibly put to make the back end create a object in the main method?"" Like it seems like he was doing all this OOP stuff, to be able to create an object in the main method that reflects a real user with all its real properties, but my question is if a user was to sign up to the fitness site, of course there isn't a programmer in real time going into the main method creating an object and passing that clients parameters in the custom constructor, so how does the instructor in the video showing that he can create a object with arguments and that that object has certain objects available correlate to a real situation where a user is interacting with the fitness site.",How does java back end OOP apply to real life?,SoftwareEngineering

"Hey all! I'm a student studying Software Engineering and for one of my classes our group project is thinking of making a Playlist Generation Feature that is based off of user input and prompt.

I'll post a quick description here (same brief we have used for our project):

**“SpeedList”** is a Spotify tool that can generate playlists based on prompts from the user. For example, a user could input the requested playlist type as ""80s Country Music"" and the feature will create a playlist with songs of the specified genre(s).

The idea for this post is to get some feedback on specific (or non-specific) traits for this feature to use as base requirements for us to program with. We are also required to crowd-source some requirements, so this is helping us with that as well. Some example requirements look like this:

* Users must be able to search keywords from available tags (genres, artists, time periods, etc.) which SpeedList will then analyze and generate a playlist according to user input, which then can then save to their Spotify library.
* Users should be able to give a specified number of songs or an approximate time length that the playlist must reflect.
* A playlist generation must take under 10 seconds.
* The SpeedList web application must be responsive such that the SpeedList page(s) loads in under 2 seconds.
* A minimum 50% of songs in the generated playlist must not be contained in a user's 'Liked' songs to promote the uniqueness of SpeedList's generation engine.

Your feedback can be as unique as you like and will be helpful to us regardless of your perspective and how you use Spotify (artist, listener, playlist curator, etc.). You can even let us know what you think if you don't use Spotify, maybe you use something like YouTube or Apple Music. Thanks for your insights!!

"Companies have embraced the concept of test automation in agile as it not only accelerated their testing process but, also led to frequent customer feedback. This in turn led to enhanced product development, thereby churning out a high-quality software product. Products are released within shorter timelines. Agile development can simply carry out its activities at a faster pace than expected through the incorporation of automation testing. Test automation also plays a crucial role in the DevOps platform. A large portion of the development pipeline can be automated. Initially, a single end-to-end scenario is automated and then run the test on a scheduled basis. In this article, you will get to know how flexibility can be maximized by implementing Agile and DevOps.

**What is test automation?**

It is a software testing practice wherein a software product such as a web application is automatically reviewed and validated. This is done to make sure that the predefined quality standards for user experience, functionality (business logic) and code style are met.

Test automation tools play a key role in carrying out automation testing activities efficiently. As many organizations are adopting agile and DevOps lifecycle, it becomes important to utilize test automation across the lifecycle to unlock the key benefits of DevOps and agile.   

**The strategic role of test automation in agile:**

Faster product release requires accelerated testing, which, in turn, requires accelerated coding. Whenever a new update to the application is released in the market, every user using that specific application expects the app to be perfectly functional. If the users are not happy then there are chances that they might switch to a competitor, which in turn may impact the brand image of the organization.  

Flawless functioning is ensured by testing each update and feature comprehensively. Such complex and feature-rich software will take a lot of time and effort to perform manually and hence automation testing is considered to be a feasible option.

Test cases are created by QAs through automation testing in agile approach. Whenever a new code is pushed to the code repository for a specific application then these test cases will run automatically. This specific practice is called as continuous testing in agile and ensures that the new code is free of bugs before it hits the production environment.

Several tools and frameworks such as Cypress, selenium etc. are used for implementing test automation in agile.  

**The strategic role of test automation in DevOps:**

Testing becomes a shared responsibility of the entire team through the DevOps platform. Developers can ship code changes quickly through the automation testing platform. Unit tests are written by developers to validate the code works as expected. 

Automated UI tests are created by product owners and quality practitioners through which the end-to-end user experience is validated. Exploratory testing sessions are organized by quality practitioners where the various application areas for issues are examined by the team manually.

Running automated tests as often and as early as possible within the CI/CD pipeline is considered to be a DevOps best practice. Automated UI tests in production are run so that user experience issues are proactively monitored. Synthetic transaction monitoring is performed by applications that rely on numerous services. Tests are run in production so that issues can be detected with third-party services before your users do.",Maximizing flexibility with Test automation in Agile and DevOps,SoftwareEngineering

"Can anyone advice me what to expect or do in my situation?

I'm a fresh grad having only a 3 months experience in a non-tech company as an intern and I had finally gotten my dream job at a product based company I've been trying to get into after graduation for so many times but my team lead gave me a warning/slash foreshadowed that I might not be here after the probation.

My probation was of 3 months. During which, first month was pretty much used up in getting me to learn Angular (I had no Angular background), the product itself, the codebase, their coding practices and such. The second month, probably in the late December, I was given my first task split into 3 tickets. All had similar work or the solution was similar in all 3 of them. So I got to work, I admit, since it is remote work so I was kinda little slow since the nature of the task was easy and I knew I could do it. So I completed the tasks before the sprint ended, actually a few days before the sprint ended and I submitted my tickets for PR.

The problem began with the constant issues rising in the PR during my team lead's feedbacks. I kept implementing those changes (mostly coding practices related and stuff). The team lead even had a peer coding session with me to show me proper coding practices of TypeScript and I learned a lot during that and thanked him for it. The issues kept rising in the 3 tickets to the point that only 1 PR got approved at the end of the sprint while the rest of the 2 kept getting reviewed in the next sprint. I was also assigned more tickets but couldn't work on those as the API wasn't available from the backend team.

I also kinda fucked up cuz I misunderstood a team lead's message and merged a branch of one of the tickets without approval. That ticket also had a syntax error that I didn't see so I worked with a guy from I'm guessing he was from QA or something, to fix this issue and roll back the changes which were thankfully only on the preview stage and nothing was harmed. But it was very humiliating for me (I didn't know approval of PRs was strictly followed and it is my mistake for forgetting that even though it was written in the coding practices document shared with me)

During the probation, I had a few communication issues with my team for which I took complete responsibility and apologized and promised to be better and I did. Got more active and responsive on Slack and etc. Now a few days ago, I requested a 1 : 1 with my team lead asking for help in clearing a blocker since the culture really emphasizes on the fact that everyone should help clear each other's blockers. That's where my team lead said something to me that is still worrying me to right now ;-;

After clearing the blocker. He said that he's not satisfied with my productivity and the quality of my work, and I'm also lacking on communication side. That I was given more than enough time to learn Angular but still I'm getting stuck on trivial problems. That even the blocker today was something covered in my course (it wasn't, I confirm this) and that I shouldn't have been stuck on it. And that, since its my probation, its very risky time for me and that once the probation ends, my manager would ask for his review and he would give his review being loyal to the company. He said that even tho I'm a fresh grad, I should really step up my game and that its a golden opportunity for me to be in this company as they don't hire fresh grads and only experienced engineers (which is true and the company is OG). That I should really step up my game and all since my probation is nearing its end and all that.

Thank goodness the camera wasn't turned on during the meeting cuz I was literally crying while saying ""okay.. okay.. yes.. my apologies.. you're right"" and he was like ""I'm not comparing you with the other hire we have (he's also a fresh grad but had a year experience in another company so he's way ahead of me in terms of productivity and coding)"" and all that. I am forgetting a few other details of what he said.

After that, I completed my PR feedbacks in the next day and completed the ticket and merged it. I am trying my best right now to be as productive as I can, as soon as I got the API set up, working with the backend guy, I made sure I could complete as much work on my end as possible on Friday before the weekend.

"Hey everyone,

I just wanted some advice on potentially switching to the software engineering/coding industry. Currently, I’m a 2nd year medical student and unfortunately, I have a health issue that came up. It’s getting more and more difficult for me to continue with medicine due to the high tuition and relentless pressure of my studies. I also worry about my future as a physician with my condition and I believe it would be better for me to pursue a work-from-home job such as software engineering.

I was wondering what is the most cost-effective and sure-fire way for me to land a position (at least starting off as a junior web-developer). I have heard that there are boot camps, are these worth pursuing? What languages should I learn? How much time will it take me generally? I have a bachelor’s in biology with no tech experience.

There are plenty multiple roles in software engineering  chain: business analysts, testers, administrators, managers, developers and so on. However, I noticed that it always goes on in this very way. Whatever  happens bad, developers always guilty and blamed. I have had situations like this: automated tests were dead broken, deployments were broken, infrastructure for devs down for days, whole project was delayed because of thus 3 months and more, then nobody cares you have less 10 business days to complete quite a big migration from spring boot 1 to 2 for big financial project ( 100+ endpoints developed for many years ). I have migrated this in time and gave it to QA testers. Nobody noticed that one ( from 100+ ) was broken, even qa testers until it hits production ( after more than 1 month ""testing"" ). Surprise, I am blamed for this, nobody else. Just I am wondering, if nobody here was guilty except from me, why companies do hire testers and others to do nothing ( because their ""testing"" has no binding value ).

U.S. citizen currently working in japan as a front end engineer and starting to learn backend (php Laravel since that’s what the company uses)

5 years experience

Skills: JavaScript, html css, Vue / Nuxt framework, some php, Python and Django

Current Role:  I manage an entire project and am the lead developer now. I manage a few part timers in a health care startup.

Past: Military veteran and a few jobs since then while teaching myself software development before I secured my current role.

Questions:

So first, I’m looking for work back in the States and am basically looking for career advice. I know I’m not the smartest tool in the shed, and I am a slow learner, but I learn.

My mentor in my current company helped me a lot with best practices, clean code, etc. I’m a lot better at my craft now than I was even two years ago.

However, now that I’m looking to move back to the states with my wife, I feel like I need to learn something more. I know front end roles still exist, but am a little worried about securing a good role to support my family.

So… advice? Should I potentially look at moving into management? Or should I continue focusing on developing backend skills?

I’ve also considered taking an online MIT course for machine learning, but to be honest, I’m not sure if it’s a good fit for me.

I know I’m not a FANG type, but I’m obviously doing something right because I secured this startup role in Tokyo and have done well. 

I just don’t have a lot of experience in this field, not like those who have done it since college. I’ve got good soft skills, but I’m also 40 (let’s not pretend ageism does not exist).

I am extremely infuriated by the wrong information that’s coming out about these tech layoffs. People are insulting tech jobs, the companies, and employees who are still employed at the companies.

Firstly, none of the employees knew this was coming. It was a shock, for a lot of them it came through them trying to login for work in the morning/trying to access a building. It really really sucked for those affected.

Secondly - there seems to be a lot of misinformation about _which_ roles got laid off exactly. Majority of them were HR, admin, operations, recruiting, etc. Not many of them were software engineering roles &amp; the ones that were happened to either be super senior roles that were basically resting &amp; vesting, or new employees who had barely been there for a year. Software engineering isn’t a dying market and it won’t be replaced with Ai anytime soon. Anyone who thinks that clearly doesn’t understand how Ai operates 🤦🏻‍♀️

Everyone knows big tech hit a hiring surge &amp; hired an insane amount of employees. Meta was in the need about hiring over 100k new employees as were many faang companies. These layoffs seem to be roughly the same % hired during that time. 

It really sucks how it happened, but for everyone worrying about them getting jobs…you have to realize these people all have big tech on their resumes &amp; will likely be scooped up by other companies in a heartbeat because of their expertise.",Recent Tech Layoffs,SoftwareEngineering

In order to recover String, the user must input some identifier for String and Password again to decrypt the cyphertext.

**My problem:** Regardless of whether Password is correct or not, my application will always output something(Of course, the only time output is meaningful is if Password is correct).

**My solution:** Along with storing String, I will store a hash of Password in every entry. When retrieving, my application will output if and only if the new Password's hash matches the hash stored in my database.

The structure of every entry in my data would subsequently be structured as follows:

id || Secondary Index || Cypher of String || Hash of Password

"Hey, I recently sat together with Michael Lynch, an ex-Googler and ex-Microsoftie who now runs his own tech start-up, Tiny Pilot.   


I asked him about software engineering practices at Google and Microsoft and how they differ from what he now does at his own start-up. We are both code review fans, so we also talked about this engineering practice.  


In a nutshell, he stressed that at Google and Microsoft, you write code that has to be supported for many, many years. In a start-up, you might not even know if the code will ever have customers. So, quality concerns are totally different.    


He also said that in a start-up, as a technical founder, you do not have to convince anybody to pay back technical debt. It's at your own discretion. So moving fast at the beginning is not such a problem.  


Still, at his own start-up, he does code reviews, also to mentor his contractors and to ensure the code is maintainable and consistent. And he also writes tests.   


But he does all of that always with an eye on the return on investment, which we should also do in other settings.

So, if it's too hard to write that unit test, he writes an integration test. And if he sees manual testing is sufficient at the moment, he does not write tests.

In parallel, i'm always trying to keep updated on new technological trends as this is mandatory in our domain. 

The thing is, since my graduation, I haven't had the occasion to put my technical knoweldge in practice. In other words, I haven't put my hands in the ""dirt"" by programming. I've kept this ""high level"" vision and only worked on making my team to converge on the objective to deliver my projects. Never got involved in the micro tasks by programming. 

I feel that I've skiped a huge step in my career and feel the need to go back to real technical stuff. I miss developping. I do code in my spare time btw (mainly game development).

"Hey everyone, 

As a second year university student studying Computer Science, I am preparing to apply for internships during my third year. However, I have no personal projects to showcase to potential employers. 

I am currently considering which dev path to take to specialize in and become a valuable swe in the future. Here's how I see it (please let me know if my assumptions are wrong): 

\- **Backend development**: This field seems to offer high-paying jobs with a higher barrier to entry. Specialization in this area is a good choice as all companies will need backend engineers especially in infra/security. 

\- **Full-Stack development**: This path doesn't seem like it would be as specialized as backend, since you would be working on both frontend and backend. However, it would make me a more versatile programmer. 

\- **iOS development**: Only need Swift, Objective-C and SwiftUI for iOS dev, can easily specialize in, smaller pool of iOS devs since you can only use macOS to develop iOS apps.

"Hi all, I'm a recent college grad who's on a premed trajectory. I'm meant to be applying to med schools in June. 

Throughout my undergrad, I've always struggled with the idea of being a doctor due to lifestyle and the duty of dealing with patients but kept on pushing down that path cause it's what I've been saying I was gonna do since I was little. However, I've always wondered if I should have studied CS instead and actually tried to switch programs my freshman year. Now that I graduated with a Chemistry degree, I'm beginning to wonder if I made the wrong decision in not switching - I don't think I'm passionate about medicine. I did programming classes every year in high school, but because it was one of the few subjects I didn't find incredibly easy I felt like I shouldn't have pursued it.

I'm at a point now where I want to explore some tech-related fields to see if it's a good fit for me. So I've got a few questions I hope I can get some help on here:

What are some ways that I can get familiar with SE and what the job is about? As much as I feel that I'm not passionate about a physician's work, I need to learn about other jobs and see what I am passionate about. 

I haven't coded much in the 4 years since hs, so what are some good sources to sharpen my skills and improve - in HS we mainly did Python

If I were to pursue SE, what's the route to take? Get a bachelors in CS? Masters? A Bootcamp? Not sure how the roadmap would look for someone in my position.

I would like the initial page load to be fast but also the subsequent page views, and from my reading CSR is better for subsequent pages and SSR is better for initial page loads

But I was unsure if route changes are considered subsequent page loads? because doesn't the window tab itself does not actually go through a page load(?) ( for example in comparison to when I enter a url in the browser and click enter) So if this is truly the case, is SSR just as good as CSR for these route changes in my app?

"As a learning exercise, I want to implement simple calendar with *recurring events*.

I'm struggling to find some papers, articles or examples what is best way to do it. So far I identified following approaches:

1. Create `abstractRecurringEvent` that is not shown on calendar. Some background job reads all `abstractRecurringEvents` and creates `normalEvents` based on `abstractRecurringEvent` for next X years.

Pros:
Relatively easy to implement.

Cons:
Background job being error prone (must keep everything perfectly in sync).
When `abstractRecurruingEvent` is deleted or modified, it has to update or modify all `normalEvents` that originated from the `abstractRecurringEvent` (this might update or delete hundreds of records).

2. Each ""day"" when renders itself checks all ""abstractRecurringEvents"" if the ""day"" matches `abstractRecurringEvents` recurrence rule. If yes, then adds an event.

Pros:
Doesn't require background process that creates events for next X years 

Cons:
In case of many `abstractRecurringEvents`, each new day might be tested against dozens of it, thus potentially slow.

I am the youngest out of my team and I always try to befriend them (even if we are only friends at the workstation).

We had a very good start of two projects, everyone is doing their tasks and work flow was awesome.

I always try to not put pressure on my team even when I get pressured from my boss.

However the last project was a nightmare, countless ""mistakes"" from one of the guys, he pushed changes without trying them, braking things and making what was the simplest project out of all the hardest.

"I am currently a mechanical engineer in an R&amp;D Prototyping role. Over the last few years I have developed increasingly bad back pain to the point where I am now considering permanent disability. I am not able to sit at a desk, stand, or work over a table for more than an hour without taking long rest breaks laying on my back, but when I am laying down I can work on a laptop with my head propped up. I am also a veteran and have access to the VA vocational rehabilitation program and I am considering making a proposal to retrain in cs. If I can do 100% remote work I think I would be able to be productive in a programming role.

Does this sound like an achievable goal? Are there opportunities out there that would be accommodating in this way, especially in a junior role?

Other pertinent information:

My back pain is not acute, but it builds up slowly over time. I can force myself to sit, stand or do other work for much longer periods but I will pay for it in pain as it builds up. This is unsustainable for my family as I come home in a lot of pain and a very bad mood after working a full day, and of course my ability to concentrate on my task diminishes as the pain increases. This means I could still occasionally grit and bear it for in person meetings or interviewing, but is not something I can do on a daily basis.

I don't have a ton of software experience so far but I did take a lower division course in C++ (that I did so well in the professor asked if I would tutor/ta for the next semester), and I had an upper level engineering dynamics course that was extremely heavy in Matlab programming for the lab portion. I also have math courses through to differential equations and linear algebra (but no discrete math).

I have a good enough GPA to apply to grad school and may be able to get a masters degree paid for by vocational rehabilitation, or alternatively I could also do a boot camp. I don't know enough about cs career fields yet to know what I would really enjoy working on but the type of problem solving and programming I have done would probably be more aligned with back end work. I think the career path might more be driven by what types of jobs would accommodate me, how saturated and needed those jobs are, and if there is a considerable difference in pay in some paths. 

I did go through the faq and wiki and found some great information in there on switching careers, but I figure the disability part of my situation makes this unique enough to write a new post.

Long story short it's kinda too late to change majors without really pushing out my graduation timeline since I'm a Junior however I do have the opportunity to add a CS minor to my finance degree with only adding an extra semester or two max.

My question is would it be better to have an Associate degree in cs or just get the minor? The minor is only recognized on the bachelor's transcript and I will not receive any certificate or diploma if I chose to go the minor route.

Testing was a big blind spot in my college's curriculum, so I had to find resources for finding out how to write good unit tests from books manually.

I joined a new company 1.5 months ago and I'm finding it challenging to navigate the codebase which doesn't seem to have standards.

"TLDR; we have an [expert beginner](https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/) making life hell, what do we do about it? Should we do something about it.

## Quick Backstory

I went to a really cool, project-driven, eye-on-industry standards type of school. I did really well and I am comfortable with the knowledge and lack thereof.

I am in my first job at a small company as a junior software engineer.  We're an OEM so we're quite heavily software based.

## The problem

Another junior and I started working there at the same time as junior software developers. We were met with our manager: the right-hand person of the CEO/almost graduating electronic engineer/embedded programmer, self-taught 'software engineer'. This person has been working at the company for 5 years already.

My fellow junior and I started noticing some really rotten things about the code base and management. It's been months of after-work deliberating on why the company is so awful to work at, and we've even been making some progress in how we think we can help the company and fix its blatant problems.

## Holy Vindication

Last night I read this: [How Developers Stop Learning: Rise of the Expert Beginner](https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/). It is as if the heavens aligned just to bestow this golden article on me. Every word of this describes our team's predicament and the cause of our anguish.

## The point

My fellow junior and I are leaving the company soon (textbook [dead sea effect](https://medium.com/geekculture/the-dead-sea-effect-d71df13724f8)). But armed with the knowledge of why the company is doing so perpetually mediocre, I have a couple of options:

- Wait until I have my next job confirmed, ready to put in my leave, then casually just drop the article in their inbox, and wait for all hell to break loose, sticking it to the man.
- Casually just drop the article in their inbox, and wait for all hell to break loose, sticking it to the man.
- With this knowledge and a bit of advice from you guys, see if I can't help them a bit with this problem that is just going unnoticed.
- Maby pass the article on to the CEO in the hopes that they see that we have a problem, and that we are suffering under our management.

## Unnecessary Final Note

It's been a rough year in this company, and this article has just been such a perfectly sobering description of why. It would just be nice for once to say: ""See, I do know what I'm talking about. We should have unit tests. You're just an expert beginner that is absolutely suffocating this company with your ego, therefore you can't even have a rational conversation about how our code is actually bad."" (We have this one file with just 23,000 lines in it)

I tried asking this question in softwareengineering.stackexchange but it was closed for being ""opinion-based"". I hope I can find an answer here, or at least an explanation for why my question is opinionated or doesn't make sense. 

Many representations of the V-model, such as the one above, show three  steps of design: system design, architecture design, and module design.  The distinction between module and architecture design seems to be  pretty straightforward: Module design is concerned with individual  components whilst architecture design is concerned with how these  compontents fit together. However, the difference between system and  architecture design is one that I failed to grasp. When I tried  searching about the distinction on the web, most of the sources I found  were trying to explain the difference between design and architecture,  or software design and software architecture, but not system design and  system architecture. The wikipedia article about the V-model says that [Systems design](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_design) is the phase where system engineers analyze and understand the business of the proposed system, but I don't see  how can understanding or analyzing be considered ""design"".",What is the difference between architecture design and system design in the V-model?,SoftwareEngineering
"In the requirements analysis stage of requirements engineering, you produce requirements models. Let them be for example domain models (UML class diagrams), use case models (UML use case diagrams) and business process models (BPMNs).

Later, in the detailed design stage, you transform requirements models into design models. For example, you transform domain models into component and interface models (UML component diagrams).

How do you satisfy the need for requirements traceability? Do you insert elements from requirements models into design models and add arrows, or do you create separate traceability diagrams?

How do you later maintain the diagrams?

Maybe you think that the most obvious solution is to import X into the project, so they reduce duplicated code in the projects codebase (don't repeat yourself!). But Team A is skeptical to do this because there is a trust problem in Team B: if the package X brakes in the future and the projects gets down because of it, it is possible that Team A gets penalized. In summary, Team A doesn't want to depend on the Team B's ability of avoiding future problems or solve a incoming one. The more time Team A gets blocked, more money is lost by the company and, since it's a Team A's project, they will be responsibilized.

"Goal-setting. I hate it.

My Question: What are some personal or work goals that you have set for yourself that you look back on with pride?

More Background:  
I am a senior software engineer with fourteen years experience. I enjoy most of the aspects of software development, and am always willing and able to learn and become adept in the ever-changing landscape of tooling and practices adopted by my organization and/or the industry at large.

I have a hard time with setting goals. I am aware of the SMART or CLEAR frameworks, but my issue is less about how to measure an outcome, and more along the lines of: what can I plan to do this year that will result in my personal growth as an engineer, and also be valuable to the company?

Some ideas: use some unfamiliar programming language to build something, obtain a relevant certification for X cloud platform, regularly contribute to open source projects the company uses, read some books about a particular topic.

My problem is that for any given year, I only have a limited amount of time to devote to these activities. They are usually only tangentially related to the work that I get paid to do, so I want to choose goals that are in-line with that work, or that I would enjoy doing after-hours.

As I'm typing this out, I'm realizing that the real issue is that I don't have time during the work day set aside to pursue these goals, so I feel like I have to do them after-hours. If it's after-hours, I don't want to do more company work, I want to do something different and refreshing that I choose that's fun to work on.

Contributing to an open source project is probably my best bet, since I'll be exposed to a variety of people and processes, and I can choose what issues look interesting to work on.

            public AdressModel Adress { get; set; }
            [Required]
            public  DateTime Created { get; set; }
            [Required]
            public virtual List&lt;PurchaseModel&gt; purchases { get; set; }
    }

each customer has an adress which I'm not showing

Each customer can also make one or more purchases, a purchase has  it's own model which looks like  this:

    public class PurchaseModel
    {
        public int Id{get;set; }
        
        [Required]
        public int  CustomerId { get; set; }
        [Required]
        public virtual CarModel Car { get; set; }
        [Required]
        public DateTime OrderDate { get; set; }
        [Required]
        public float PricePaid { get; set; }
        [Required]
        public  SalesPersonModel SalesPerson { get; set; }
    }

There is also a car model for each purpose, which o'm also omitting.

Each purchase has been made with the help of a salesperson, which is modelled like this:

&amp;#x200B;

    public class SalesPersonModel
    {
        public int Id{get;set; }
        [Required]
        public string Name { get; set; }
        // would we really want coworkers to see each others salary?
        [Required]
        public Title JobTitle { get; set; }
        [Required]
        public virtual AdressModel Adress { get; set; }
        [Required]
        public uint Salary { get; set; }
    }
    

Now, I have a function which takes a QueryModel object which checks all the input fields, and then filter according to them

&amp;#x200B;

It looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

        public static async Task&lt;List&lt;CustomerModel&gt;&gt; FilterCustomerList(this DemoContext context, QueryModel query)

            switch (query.sortBy)
            {

                {
                    customersQuery = customersQuery.OrderByDescending(c =&gt; c.Age);

                }

                {
                    customersQuery = customersQuery.OrderByDescending(c =&gt; c.Created);
                    break;
                }
                case SortBy.Age_asc:
                {
                    customersQuery = customersQuery.OrderBy(c =&gt; c.Age);
                    break;
                }
                case SortBy.CreationDate_asc:
                {
                    customersQuery = customersQuery.OrderBy(c =&gt; c.Created);
                    break;
                }
            }
    
            
    
            var customers = await customersQuery
                .ToListAsync();
    
            return customers;
        }

The first part is pretty straight forward, I just filter directly on my customer object since it has all the navigational properties needed on the customer object.

&amp;#x200B;

But, I also need to filter on the attributes of the salespeople that have sold cars to different customers, and then return the list of customers based on that.

Since I don't have a direct relation between a customer and the salespeople that that customer have used, I have the second block of where clauses, where I first filter all the purchases, based on the customers they have, and get the purchases that have used the specific salespeople.

After getting all the correct purchases, I get the correct customers by comparing with the purchases, and seeing if they relate to the customer.

&amp;#x200B;

The last part feels a bit clunky and it feels like I could be structuring the relations in a better way that could allow me to make more simple queries.

"# One of the most powerful ways to improve or maintain code quality is proper code reviews.

But many teams face challenges from outside of Engineering to protect the time to do code reviews well.

Here’s how we would explain to a non-technical colleague why code reviews are essential.

# First, you will lose engineers without a culture of mentorship and learning.

Engineers are among the most in-demand positions for all companies across the globe. COVID and Work From Home sped up the globalization of the talent market for engineers. As a result, companies need to invest in their Engineers aggressively. If you’re not actively building a great place to work, you’re on the losing end of the war for talent.

One of the ways to build a great place for engineers to work is to shape an environment that supports mentorship. Learning and exploring on the job is no longer a “perk” but a requirement. Engineers are deeply curious, and code reviews are a great way to facilitate a learning culture.

# Second, you will fast-track the effectiveness and productivity of new engineers.

If you hire new engineers or bring in third-party development shops and freelancers, you want to ramp them up as quickly as possible. Code reviews fast-track the onboarding process.

The difference between an effective and ineffective onboarding is six months or more of lost productivity. Unproductive onboarding means wasted financial resources and time, slower time to market, and ultimately, losing pace with your competitors.

# Third, engineering effectiveness and velocity will be lower without code reviews.

Your CEO will undoubtedly have heard the concept of “10X developers.” Whether or not that’s true is a discussion for another time.

Code reviews are a way to create 10X teams. It’s a great way – in my view, perhaps the best way – to continuously improve the quality of the entire team, not just an individual. This is because coding is fundamentally a craft, not a competition– a rigorous skilled activity that requires learning from more experienced experts and one that requires deep knowledge and concentration.   


The greater the investment in growth and learning, the higher the team's effectiveness will be.","how to explain the importance of code reviews to CEOs, Sales, Finance and other non-technical audiences-- three tips",SoftwareEngineering

"An interdisciplinary team of researchers at the University of Glasgow is running a short survey seeking the views of software practitioners on how sustainability considerations influence their day-to-day practice.

The development of societies and economies that are sustainable is now an urgent priority, recognised by both individual governments and multi-national organisations. Many organisations are beginning to implement measures in response. However, sustainability can be understood in different ways by different stakeholders from different perspectives. The aim of this study is to understand how software practitioners understand and respond to sustainability challenges in their professional lives.

You can participate in the survey using the link below.

"I've started working on a large software engineering project lately and my experience so far has been this:

1. Try to find the project goals
2. Try to come up with ways on how to achieve those goals
3. Try to find a techstack that supports those ways
4. Go halfway into the implementation based on that techstack
5. Realize it doesn't work out the way you originally planned
6. Panic because this could mean that you might have to change a large part of the implementation or even techstack
7. Somehow come up with a way to make it work with the current techstack but it's a bit clunky
8. Wish there was someone you could ask on how to do it better but there probably is none
9. Repeat at step 1

"I read an article and forgot completely where it was from except that it was some sort of a blog. It asked what is the real value-carrying product of software engineering and claimed that it is not code itself but the mapping between it and the real-world problem: how different parts and aspects of the code correspond to different features of the problem.

I remember two phenomena that the author explained with this idea. The first is the inconsequentiality of Twitch's code leak. If the value of software engineering lies in code, then Twitch lost all of its value in the leak. Concretely, potential competitors would have everything they need to create similar companies and cut into Twitch's profits. The author claims this didn't happen because the mapping between the code and the problem, which is Twitch's real asset, lies in the engineers' minds. It was not made publicly available by the leak and therefore potential competitors don't have what they need in order to recreate the platform.

A second phenomenon I think I remember from the article is the urge to rewrite projects that are reassigned from someone else who is no longer available. If the code itself were the asset, rewriting would be nothing more than a waste of resources. But programmers often find themselves wishing to rewrite code that they received from someone else. This, claims the author, makes sense. Code (ideally) starts out as clean and simple but gets more complicated as the problem becomes more well understood. These complications match different aspects of the problem Again, the mapping between them and the problem exists in the original developers' heads. When new developers get the project without being able to communicate with the original ones, they are not familiar with the different aspects of the problem and therefore perceive the complexity as a liability. Starting from scratch enables them to recreate the natural flow from simple to complicated code coupled with the creation of a conceptual model matching the problem.

Does anyone know where this article is from? Any help would be greatly appreciated.",Help me find this article about the real asset that software engineering produces,SoftwareEngineering

"Full Spring Boot authentication microservice with Domain-Driven Design approach and CQRS.

Domain Driven Design is like a art of writing a good code. Everything around the code e.g. database (maria, postgres, mongo), are just a tools that supports the code to work. Source code is a hart of the application and You should pay attention mostly to that.  DDD is one of the approaches to create beautiful source code.

**This is a list of the main goals of this repository:**

* Showing how you can implement a Domain-Drive design
* Showing how you can implement a CQRS
* Presentation of the full implementation of an application
   * This is not another proof of concept (PoC)
   * The goal is to present the implementation of an application that would be ready to run in production
* Showing the application of best practices and object-oriented programming principles

**GitHub**
 [github repo](https://github.com/tlandeka/authentication-microservice-with-domain-driven-design)

Your contribution:
* Give it a star
* Share it

**A brief overview of the architecture**

The used approach is DDD which consists of 3 main layers: **Domain**, **Application**, and **Infrastructure**. 

*Domain* \- Domain Model in Domain-Driven Design terms implements the business logic. Domain doesn't depend on Application nor Infrastructure.

*Application* \- the application which is responsible for request processing. It depends on Domain, but not on Infrastructure. Request processing is an implementation of CQRS read (**Query**) / write (**Command**). Lots of best practices here.

*Infrastructure* \- has all tool implementations (eg. HTTP (HTTP is just a tool), Database integrations, SpringBoot implementation (REST API, Dependency Injection,  etc.. ). Infrastructure depends on Application and Domain. Passing HTTP requests from SpringBoot rest controllers to the Application Layer is solved with “McAuthenticationModule”. In this way, all relations/dependencies between the Application Layer and Infrastructure layer are placed into only one class. And it is a good design with minimized relations between layers.

Tests: The type of tests are grouped in folders and it is also good practice and it is fully testable which means - minimized code smells. So the project has:

* integration tests
* unit test",Authentication microservice with Domain Driven Desing and CQRS (not PoC),SoftwareEngineering

"Curious if anyone has experience writing polyglot APIs (multiple langs within the same endpoint, not different micro-services in different languages), or experiences with language interop? If so, are there any resources that helped you learn?

**Background:**

At my job, we tend to use c#, ts and python. Over the last couple of years I've had to implement apis in all 3 languages. It just has me wondering if writing api's from scratch across languages is bit of a waste. I.e. why don't we write all our web apis in just c#, and try to interop with other languages when we're trying to leverage some lang specific lib?

I can imagine that there might be some pitfalls to what I'm suggesting, such data transfer challenges and overhead, multithreading issues if either language involved in the interop is trying to do something multithreaded, tooling complications, etc. But it seems like a small team trying to implement APIs in 3 different languages is also not an ideal situation either, since it's hard to master the quirks of any backend framework. So I'm wondering if there's a ""right"" way to go about language interop?

I'd love to be able to write c# APIs, and have them communicate with python or ts libs as needed. So far suggestions I've seen involve spawning processes and calling scripts, communicating with a grpc server running on a socket in the same vm/serverless function. If anyone has lived experience doing these things, or suggestions about resources on this topic, I would greatly appreciate any advice 🙏",Polyglot APIs/software in practice,SoftwareEngineering

"Hello. I'm an early-career software engineer with a history of learning new languages through sources like Codecademy. I find myself, now, in a workplace that loves to play TDD ping-pong and I'm thinking of starting a group project where we create a TDD ping pong matchmaking site and, in-browswer, you can run whatever language, test suite, etc. we allow you to configure. 

So, naturally, before running to Reddit and begging for help, like any good engineer I did my due diligence and thought it through. VMs came to mind, and whenever I think VM, I think Docker (yes I'm aware it's not a vm, it's a container), so maybe these environments get set up by a dockerfile and the front-end would be a web-socket between users, the editors and interface a bunch of typescript/jsx.

"We are building software for a client that requires a variety of third party website providers to be able to create &amp; update records in our client's database. The gold standard has always been some sort of feed implementation which looks like this:

1. Build a system to consume a feed
2. Ensure each feed has a unique reference
3. Create documentation for third party to build a feed to our specification
4. Get them to provide a URL to their feed (json, xml, or something like that)
5. Enter URL into our system and consume the feed to populate database

However, we've been toying with the idea of instead simply building a REST API, along with the appropriate documentation, which allows the third party to consume and ultimately POST &amp; UPDATE records in our database. There are limitations to this however, compared with the feed approach.

I am looking for some opinions, tips, tricks, tutorials or ideas for this kind of implementation. Have you every built something like this in the past? How did you do it?

"I’m a software engineer at a top tech company. Recently, I was given a task that’s straight forward but requires following documentation to do it. The documentation is incredibly confusing and disorganized. It’s very unclear how you’re supposed to accomplish this task, the team responsible for it is in a different timezone and responds only once every 24-48 hours. I’m killing myself to finish the task. Every day I’m being ask to provide an update, I’m being told this needs to be done ASAP, needs to be done really fast, etc. 

Today my manager told me that this was taking way too long and they expected it to be finished by now, and that they were considering just having someone else do it and taking me off. He said “\[other engineer\] said it was really easy to do this.” Basically telling me that I’m incompetent or a bad engineer. When I asked \[other engineer\] if he could help me, he said the person who had done the same thing had left the company so he wasn’t able to help me. So turns out he didn’t even do it, he was just saying it was easy.

Since he asked to see, I walked my manager through what I was doing and I could see how confused he was getting by how the process/documentation works. 

I wanted more than anything to say “if it’s so easy, why don’t you do it?” But I’ve already done about 70% of the work and they would just take credit for it. 

It’s really frustrating, it’s causing me a lot of stress and it seems really unfair. Generally I do like working at this company and the people/culture.  Now it's the weekend and I'm just unhappy and stressed.

I provide 1.5 hours to work through the exercise.  I expect the interviewee to read the instructions and requirements, review the existing code and then write tests, refactor and add the new functionality.  I encourage them to verbalize their thought processes and even give them hints if they seme to get stuck. I only use this for senior level roles.  That said, people seriously struggle getting through the exercise with a significant level of hand-holding.  Many are  currently in a senior level role.

"Alright, so I've got a Java/SpringBoot web service I am building. This service contains an endpoint that is exclusively for updating existing data. It is very possible that multiple users may decide to update a single record at the same time. I would say the likelihood of this is relatively low, but it is possible.

My first thought was to check the lastUpdateTimestamp on the database record before saving the update. I record the current timestamp as soon as the update begins, and there's a bunch of pre-processing that happens before saving the update, so if this value is higher than the one I'm about to set it to, that means that another update beat this request to the database, and I reject this one.

So far so good. However, checking the lastUpdateTimestamp and then saving (or throwing an exception) is a textbook race condition. To solve this, I wrapped the whole thing in a synchronized block. Problem solved.

Except... it's not really solved. This application is going to be deployed on a cloud service provider where it will scale from anywhere between four and twelve instances, depending on the current load. Everything I've put into place to prevent this race condition only works at the single-instance level and doesn't prevent this kind of update operation across multiple records.

Anyway, I'm wondering if anyone knows of any solutions that can be put into place to prevent this kind of issue? It's all going to the same database, maybe that's where the protection has to live?

"Memeing is a double-edged sword. Apparently the recent vulnerability discovered with Apache log4j has become common knowledge with non-technical and technical people alike, which raised a few questions in my unit about whether or not we use it for logging.

The conversation went like this:

    PM: qq, do we use log4j for any of our applications?
    Me: no. [open source software] is built on PHP, not Java
    .... [some Googling to double check]
    Me: full disclosure, one of our microservices is built on Lumen which uses Apache log4php, a log4j port. They're not the same and the former hasn't had any reported vulnerabilities on the same scale
    PM: what does that mean?
    Me: we're safe
    PM: hmm. We're going to have to re-assess

There are surely some gaps in this unit's process because this conversation shouldn't be happening between a (non-lead) developer and a PM. My TL is on leave and I'm basically left to advise when I don't feel I'm the right person to.

"Everyone knows they need it. You can have test coverage software to make sure that you're not leaving components untested. Of course I'm making the assumption that the code base is coded to SOLID standards as is fully testable and you understand how unit-test frameworks operate in the sense of using things like mocking &amp; spying. My issue isn't with the technical side of it.

The real issue is how do specific suites of unit tests bring actual business value in the terms of:

* are we verifying all the correct possibility of variants &amp; invariants?
* Who is responsible and at what points in the project for identifying all the critical mass of assertions in a service/application?

The latter one is especially important because theoretically I could simply put Assert.IsTrue(true) in all my tests and they pass 100% but bring 0% business value. Of course in the real world, nobody ethical is doing that and competent code reviewers would catch that.

The real hard part is in reality to me it seems that nobody is really really reviewing the assertions to know if they're a) correct b) how many assertions did you miss? That's really hard work, everyone is super busy and things will fall through the cracks.

"I'm a decade into working as a software engineer and I can confidently say that one of the worst things I ever did was not choose a speciality and stick with it (mobile, frontend, backend, data engineer, data science etc). 

While it's ok to learn a lot of different things as a software engineer, you should not work at a place that exploits that learning by not having defined roles. I just left a job that developer after developer quit I ended up being a ""yes"" man. I took on several mobile, frontend and backend responsibilities which lead to major burnout from management requesting features and fixes in languages I haven't even touched in my career. I found that by doing that I ended up missing deadlines and taking a reputation hit when in reality those roles should have been filled from management requesting more hires. 

Rant over, but it's crucial for new software engineers to understand that you'll be rewarded more for being an expert in your field instead of a generalist that's always having to stay up late and learn new languages in very little time to push out features that you won't fully understand the tradeoffs of the languages you crash coursed.

=========


Response: It’s going to be hard to go through every comment and have a discussion without getting blasted. Let me ask you this question: What would you do when this (below) happens?


Team members that leave:
- Lead developer 
- New lead developer 
- Site reliability engineer
- infrastructure engineer
- Senior software engineer
- Junior Software Engineer
- Mid-level software engineer
- Mid-level software engineer
- Project manager

Remaining team:
- Senior software engineer
- Software Engineer
- Software Engineer
- Software Engineer

So now you’ve got one senior and three mid-level software engineers doing the work of 9 people that have left.

This was my point when you start doing it all it’s time to leave. If you don’t you’re going to put yourself in a really bad place in your life as relationships are going to suffer, your mental health is going to suffer and your physical health is going to suffer of course that’s just the tip of the iceberg. 

Again go read up top again if you missed the point, it’s good to learn a lot of different things but when you start having to do it all you should leave because that shows it’s a management issue. Beware of managers commenting on this post telling you that you should stay, if you’d like to throw yourself under a bus for your team go for it but you’re going to suffer.

Also when I say you should “specialize” I’m talking about an “area” not a language that’s why I mentioned the areas above. When you specialize in an area that means you can be very effective and get stuff done which is all that really matters. You can’t avoid learning about a lot of other things but you should try to be T-shaped in your experiences.

"Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a Software Engineer / Architect at a privacy-oriented startup. Due to public regulations, we cannot use US-Software infrastructure/cloud providers in general and need to keep all data on our ""own"" servers (we are using a german infrastructure provider).

For that, we'll need to start building a catalogue  of integrations for external services to access/read/write data from third party systems \*of our customers\*. So we need to provide those integrations to our users so they can connect their systems. 

I stumbled across the term ""embedded iPaas"", which pushed me towards a make-vs-buy decision. Those offer exactly that - embedding such an integration catalogue and sometimes workflow builders for more complex logic. However, most of them are in the cloud/too complex/too stiff for our use case.

Therefore, we are currently evaluating licensing such a platform vs. building these API connectors ourselves.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have experience with building/using such a integration catalogue? If you already interacted with/built something like that, I'd be very interested in your opinion on the topic.  
Should you have very deep knowledge in the field, I'd also be willing to pay for a bit of your time to discuss your experience.

"Hey everyone. I work in the enterprise solutions space, and one of the big features of the software platform that my company provides is the ability to create multiple versions of different web applications. There is a complicated proprietary process that it uses to achieve this, but essentially the end result is that you can create multiple versions of an application that is served to different users based on certain criteria, like what their job is or where they are operating out of. These different versions are analogous to branches on a VCS system in that they all are based off of a master version, but the key difference is that they are never meant to be merged back to master. They exist as their own separate version that is maintained and can be provisioned for deployment.

I have been thinking a lot lately about how this is achieved, and I realized that I am not really sure what is common practice for this sort of thing. I'm interested in trying to see if other people have experience with this kind of problem, and what the approach of most software developers is because I am pretty ignorant to it. I am not really interested in debating what approach is best, more about what approaches are out there. I guess the only way to tackle it would be to include a common software package or runtime, and have that act as a dependency for different applications, but that seems to be a very frustrating answer for me because it still leaves the coordination of the management and maintenance of multiple distributions up in the air. Also, in my experience, there is always a lot of drama around creating dependencies...

So what do you guys think? Are there any common approaches to this? Or is it squarely in the realm of enterprise platforms...",What approaches exist for maintaining different Application distributions?,SoftwareEngineering

"First time posting here. I feel a bit lost and wanted to see if anyone else has this problem. Let’s say it’s Monday and I just got off a meeting with some things to do for the week (some small bug fixes) and a bigger task that needs to be finished by the end of the month.

I tend to spend quite a lot of time on Reddit and basically procrastinate. Time flies and it’s already Thursday. I do know what I have to do but just looking at those deadlines makes me want to postpone everything as much as possible. When I finally get to work I get stressed cuz I have to finish everything on time. This is a never-ending cycle for me and it really wears me off.

Not to mention that whenever I get in the flow it so happens that someone messages me with some random question and it completely derails me.

This makes me think, perhaps the problem is my time management skills and not all those distractions.

I tried so many tactics and couldn’t find one that would click with me, so am curious what you guys do/did to get things done and don’t stress too much?

PS.

"To give a little backstory on the issue I am facing... 

I have been working on a rather large personal project for the last 8 months or so. Just for some context, it is essentially a Sports League Management SaaS Product (Think about managing a youth sports league). I have a pretty solid idea of what the end product will look like and how it will operate. The problem I am having is that I feel like I keep going in circles which I will outline below. 

The only constant that has remained throughout this project is that I am using Postgres as the DB and Vue 3 with Quasar for the Frontend. Here are some of the circles I have gone in... 

* I started with the idea I would use Django REST as the backend, and after 3-4 months of using it, it become increasingly more complex for me to do things that were needed. So I ended up switching to .NET 6.0 as my backend which took another month or so to write out the barebones of the backend. 
* I originally had the bright idea of handling user authentication/authorization myself, however, after a couple of months I realized how difficult it would be to do that correctly and securely, which led to me switching over to firebase auth. Learning how that worked and modifying the API and my DB to account for that took another month or so. 
* After a couple of months of working with Axios on the front end, I was running into some difficulties and decided to switch over to fetch, which hasn't been a terribly long process, but just another set of things I needed to change. 

Finally what led me to make this post, I am currently making calls to firebase from the front end, and after having everything implemented I started to think it would be a better idea to make those firebase calls from my .NET backend instead. After realizing yet again this would be another huge refactor, I realized going about things the way I am is in no way productive. 

Ultimately, that leads me to my question, how can I organize myself and properly manage a project from start to finish and get out of the refactor hell I keep getting stuck in?",Struggling to complete a large project from start to finish,SoftwareEngineering

"Just joined a new team as a contractor and their codebase is fundamentally flawed. It was written by juniors and it shows. They tried to be clever and now everything is hyper complicated, extremely abstract and completely inflexible.   
Api's take 20-30 arguments to handle various edge cases, a lot of the code is fragile and there is stuff polluting global space.   


I can spot all these problems and know what kinds of problems they will cause in the future, but I'm not sure how (and if) it's a good idea to clean all of that up. Rewriting everything is always a bad idea. I also don't want to alienate the team by telling them how bad all their work was. In addition, management keeps pushing for new features and I haven't managed to successfully convince them that we need time to clean up our mess. They want to release soon, but we're flooded with all the bugs that come from the terrible architecture. 

Do you guys have some advice / articles / strategies on how to deal with this situation? My gut instinct is to fix everything asap before it's used more widely. But then again I always hear horror stories about new team members that try to redo everything, so I'm hesitant to just straight up do it.",How do you save a bad codebase?,SoftwareEngineering

"Hi all,

First post. Please be gentle.

I’m a Data Engineer. Data has a notoriously bad approach to development compared to the software space and I want to bring some of the good to the data space.

I’m struggling with branching strategies. We need a dev/stg/prd data warehouse, and we use dbt to build it. Dbt lets you write a combination of SQL and jinja and compiles at run time to build the tables and views in the data warehouse using a DAG to ensure the right things are built in the right order.

The current approach is to have main/stg/dev branches. We create a feature off dev, then back to dev, through stg and into main. The branch is directly linked to the relevant database. The code is compiled from the contents of the branch, and run against the warehouse (which updates the data in the warehouse using the appropriate logic). The impact of this is that if we get two user stories through to stg for two different teams, with one team able to test right away and the other not until next week, the first team has to wait for the second team to approve before anyone can get their stuff through to main. It’s a monolithic deployment.

We’ve been strongly steered away from cherry picking.

Is there any other way? Guidance would be greatly appreciated.",Git branch strategy with compiled code,SoftwareEngineering

"Because different people prefer different coding styles, and coding style is a contentious subject, could we build an IDE plug-in that displays code according to the user's preferred style, *without changing the underlying source code file*? That is, could we enable what could be called ""virtual code"" or ""code virtualization""?

Whereas Jack might prefer horizontal code with 120-character lines, Jim might prefer vertical code with 80-character lines. The source code file itself might be written in Jack's style, but Jim can still view (and by certain IDE features, edit) the file while leaving the contents of the source code file in Jack's format, by selecting an option from the code virtualizer. Then Jim can read and comprehend the code more easily in the format he is used to.

"As in, the same category? Just curious what your opinions are.

From my perspective living in the US, I would mostly say no. It falls more into the “engineering” category to me than IT. Though, many IT departments at various companies will have software engineering teams within them doing their own thing. These dev teams create proprietary software catered directly to the IT company’s IT related needs. Then IT professionals will work to sell and deploy these new software solutions into the customer facing world. 

So IT to me is more about the deployment and maintenance of current technology systems within the working world. In other words, there is little designing of new technology in IT. Rather, the IT professional’s job is to know the current existing technologies in and out, and be able to deploy them wherever needed to meet the needs of customers. This also includes managing their servers, networks and monitoring them. An IT may also write small programs and scripts to accomplish the needs of the customer. But for larger software projects that require a dedicated development team to reach the goal, the job has now drifted away from IT, and into software engineering.",Do you consider software engineering to be an “IT” job?,SoftwareEngineering

"What I mean is that if I want to authenticate for Application A, my OAuth2 /token request must contain the Client ID &amp; Client Secret for Application A as the Basic Auth header of the request.

For the Authorization Code flow, this makes perfect sense. In Auth Code, Application A will delegate to the Authorization Server for the actual user login. Then, once it gets back the Authorization Code, it will send that request, and the Client ID and Secret **are its own id/secret.** I've got no questions related to Authorization Code, this flow makes perfect sense.

Client Credentials, now here I start to have questions. The purpose of Client Credentials, as I see it, is to allow Application B to talk to Application A. Based on what I've read in the OAuth2 specification, for Application B to get an access token for Application A, it will have to send a Client Credentials request with the Client ID/Secret for Application A as the Basic Auth header. This seems to compromise the critical security of Application A by forcing it to share its ID/Secret.

The same thing applies to the Password grant type. I know this one is heavily discouraged, I only ever use it for testing APIs, never for any actual production communication. However, in this case, the user trying to authenticate for access to Application A needs the Client ID/Secret of Application A, yet again compromising the security of those credentials.

I would think that the ideal implementation for those two grant types would be as follows:

Client Credentials, you would use the Client ID/Secret of Application B, plus the ID of Application A, and then the authorization server would grant a token if Application B has been configured to have access to Application A.

Password, you would only need the username/password credentials, plus the ID of Application A, and yet again the authorization server would grant a token if the user has been configured to have access to Application A.

If someone with a little more perspective on OAuth2 can explain this to me, that would be great. I'm misunderstanding something here, either the ideal way to use OAuth2 to work with these grant types, or some piece of how it's supposed to be configured. Thanks.",Why does the OAuth2 specification require the client id/secret on all grant types?,SoftwareEngineering

Share your current employment methods/  frameworks / tools / processes for embedded secure software development, and any issues / challenges, or successes. If you could also share the industry and general size of the organization, for reference.

My previous roles have been pretty lacking in terms of secure practices.

Industry: Large Defense Contractor working on Government Project

Methodology: Agile

Secure Frameworks: None specified.

Tools: Automated static analysis tools in CI builds

Processes: On feature milestones, external penetration testers brought in to provide feedback on vulnerabilities


Issues: No training provided to developers. Security was not embedded. We had some horrendous security flaws when a prototype project, was 'sold' to the Government, and instead of being redesigned, it was 'enhanced.' 


Other Comments: Our senior development team thought about the security of the technology in use: We had secure communication methods prescribed, we had solid data encryption and backup processes, users required 2fa, only supported certain usbs, secure boot, custom hardware etc etc. The in-use security from 'the enemy' was considered, but the security of the software itself wasn't considered thoroughly.



In my current role:

Zero security consideration except for security updating the 3rd party software we use, and just the individual skill / knowledge of the developer - no training provided, or minimum standard expected. No security testing at all. 

I need a little help here with some industry research. I'm doing a masters of Cyber Security, and as part of an assignment, we're discussing how 'in the real world' people are developing secure software. But, online people don't publicize how they're developing their software, especially when it's only 'half' considered.",How does your organization integrate secure software practices in software development?,SoftwareEngineering

"Every single book I've ever read on software development says the same thing: Never over-engineer your system. This initially makes sense to me. The problem I have is that it seems as though software engineering is the only discipline in which flexibility and improvisation are skills that are considered appropriate. 

When we want to engineer a building, a plane, or a car, it makes sense that we'd want to have the entire system perfectly designed beforehand. Because of the consequences of bad design, this makes sense. When we look at software development, however, I constantly hear about the horror stories of terrible legacy code and of being able to adjust our structure on the fly. 

In what world is it okay for an aerospace engineer to just say ""Well, the engine and the battery are fused together but at least they work"" or a civil engineer to say ""F\*ck it, just add more pillars and cement""?

For the legacy code part: Are so many software engineers really that bad at writing good code? What makes software engineering such poor engineering?

For the flexibility of development part: Is it really that hard to have a CLEAR idea of large systems before a single line of code is written?

Full disclosure: I'm a CS student and my largest projects aren't more than a few thousand lines of code, so I really don't know much about the world.",Why is it that SE is the only engineering where too much upfront design is looked down on?,SoftwareEngineering

"My current team went for a long time without a defined firefighting rotation.  A few months ago we formalized a rotation and for the most part the team is liking it.  The biggest pain point so far is the calendar.

* We initially created a shared calendar in outlook and due to the way the teams are defined at an enterprise level this didn't work very well.  
* When we took our concerns to IT they suggested we use the calendar built into Teams (unfortunately we're neck deep in the M$ ecosystem).  
* The teams calendar didn't work because in teams the team is actually multiple teams and they all got spammed with emails.  
* We have confluence and I know there is a calendar feature in there but I haven't played with it.  
* Microsoft has a tool called Shifts which seems promising at first - it allows people to trade days, it shows everyone the schedule for the entire team.  But it was just one more place that people had to check and it didn't alert at the start of the week so people didn't realize they were on.   
* I could just schedule each individual on their own calendar and mark it as not busy, but that seems like a fall back if I can't find a real solution.",How do you organize firefighting schedules?,SoftwareEngineering

"I work for a company that has a very mature code base (20+ years) that's essentially endless, undocumented spaghetti. Up until very recently, the development team was 4 people. The company got acquired along with three other international companies in the same industry and jammed under one roof.

The people who have been at the largest company for awhile really don't want anything to change--they'll disrupt meetings, ignore emails, play dumb, etc to avoid change. The problem is that none of the legacy code is compatible with framework versions published after 2011. They don't want the projects currently being written to touch, update, or use modern security while interfacing with their legacy code, so they're doing all this in service of making integration with anything older really hard. 

Many of my tasks concern writing anti corruption layers, to permit that integration. It's hard to integrate if you can't get any information on what needs to be integrated, if the older team keeps logging objections that require everything to stop and potentially be re-architected because there's suddenly a new use case/surprise requirement change/oh that isn't even the thing that was supposed to be integrated with/oops we forgot to tell you, etc. Because there's no documentation of the mature code base, the newer teams can't easily check on anything for themselves, and the code base is in such bad shape that it can take a month to try and figure out what a section of it is doing, which we're doing, but it's slow going.

The management is the same way: been there for decades and systematically under-provisioning or not helping with new projects. It can take months to get basic questions answered (if at all).

The investment company that bought on the new CTO and CEO have an agenda to create a bunch of new software, integrations, and to rewrite that code base, and in fact I was bought on for part of that. The management tells them that the projects doing new stuff are fully provisioned and everything is great, even when the project is stalled or critically behind.

I have a ton of this documented and have sent that documentation by request to the new system architect, but in the mean time all my projects have stalled and the management is making all sorts of weird, gaslight-y claims (like they were never informed of things that were the subject of meetings they are logged as having attended, or they have no idea what I'm talking about for project requirements they told and emailed me about, or they simply will not acknowledge project documentation that requires approval, etc.)

I'm starting to feel kinda crazy here. It doesn't help that the managers are using the PO and the scrum master to load work way outside the team's skills and the agreed on purpose for our team into the board over our objections--there's always an emergency and we're told that we should really be feeling sorry for other people if we object to the pile of work, because apparently everyone has it worse?

"Hey guys,

Current position:

I am currently doing a software engineering internship at Intel but I am not really developing my software engineering skills at the speed I can if I go by myself.

Plan:

I am planning to quit the internship and quit school and start solving problems by building software applications.

Background:

I have been developing for 1.5 years and have around 9 months of work experience. I have a base of full stack development and software engineering but I lack knowledge of some things like deployment, testing, and systems designing. The stack I am mainly going to use involves: React (Typescript), Nest.js, TypeORM SQL, Docker and Github

Goal:

What I want to achieve is being able to solve problems and build software applications on a lower/medium scale (this is important because I don't see myself working on large-scale projects alone, because it takes more time, more people, and is more complex. Also if I am at that point, I can hire people who have better knowledge than me to learn from). I want to be able to develop as fast as possible with sufficient clean code/architecture (again the goal is to solve the problem as fast as possible with the lowest sufficient ""clean score"", not build the cleanest software possible). Obviously, there is importance in clean code but up to a certain point, does it REALLY matter? I doubt it. There are plenty of people making a bunch of money with meh code. I want to be able to get an MVP in &lt; 1 month (a bit vague haha). I also doubt I need to know the ins and outs of f.e Kafka, Kubernetes and have a ci/cd pipeline that takes 3 hours to complete.

Question:

How can I achieve this? How can I go from being able to program on a junior/low medior engineer to a ""coding god"", where can I learn how to be able to define clear problems, develop things, test things and deploy things as fast as possible?",How do I learn to develop e2e projects?,SoftwareEngineering

I've picked up a job working with some very smart people, primarily mathematicians and engineers specialising in scientific computing, something I'm quite happy about as someone who has never gone to university. Unfortunately the code they write is a little ridiculous. I am trying to expand my skillset and dive into non front end portions of our stack (Python at the moment) but am finding the the code my team members have written extremely dense, to the extent that they try and explain it to me and the most I can do is either ask again 2-3 times until it kind of makes sense or just sit and nod with a blank eyed stare. It doesn't help that they are all nearly a decade older than me and not very approachable, especially when working remotely. I am left having to try and work through it myself, which is a bit overwhelming even for someone with 7.5 years of experience.

I am studying software engineering and my biggest question so far is do professional software engineers remember all languages they learn? I take my courses i use a language and after i use it i pick up a new language and  i seem to forget the syntax of the previous language i learned. I know how programming languages work ive got that down well so if im working on a new project i know what i need to do and what to do but i always forget the syntax and find myself searching google for the correct syntax and formatting of the language. Im a little bit nervous about this because i feel unprofessional and behind from everybody else by doing this and i want to know if i should push myself harder to remember them.,Remembering Languages,SoftwareEngineering

"Hello, SWE Subreddit!

There are many articles out there that praise the benefits of migrating to microservices. However, the monolith still provides a lot of advantages, mostly thanks to the shared code base and the simplified cross-domain access patterns and testing practices. In order to migrate successfully out of the monolith, at my company, we had to deal with lots of unique pain points, and systematically address them to fully realize the benefits of the microservices architecture. 

I wrote this article to share with the community an overview of the main challenges that we faced: changes in reliability patterns, the proliferation of new tech stacks, cumbersome data migrations, loss in workflow observability, changes in how we approach testing, building a data access layer and defining deployment etiquette. Check out the article if you'd like to know the details and how DoorDash tackled each pain point.

Are there any senior/experienced software engineers here who have had that luxury of actively using Cloud in the processes? Honestly hoping to learn from you all!

"Greetings internet person, I hope you're safe and well.  
I'm  inexperienced with the email domain but my task is to setup an email  service provider and was hoping to get some feedback/help with my  endeavor.

Here's a list of initial requirements for context:

1. Support both inbound and outbound mail functionality for 500-2000 users.
2. Support only non-promotional mail.
3. Provide deliverability comparable to a well known email service (gmail, yahoo).
4. Not required to support IMAP/POP3 clients.
5. Support only a single domain and potentially multiple sub-domains.
6. Support for unlimited addresses (left of the '@' delimiter)

Here's my first attempt at an implementation plan.

1. Use AWS SES as a SMTP relay for outbound mail. I don't currently maintain a mail server so the plan is to use the RPC API.
2. Use the SES smtp server for inbound mail (pointing our domain's MX record to SES).
3. Store mails persistently in S3.
4. Verify a single root domain and comply with SPF, DKIM and DMARC.
5. Manage accounts, inboxes and clients by myself.

Does anyone have experience setting something like this up? Is there anything I'm missing?

Some specific problems I'd appreciate help with:

1. How does my choice of AWS SES region affect the end user? I'm assuming just latency but is there something else I should know?
2. There  are two kinds of ""reputations"" I need to keep my eye on. One for the  SES servers itself but also my reputation with SES. Outbound mail that's  flagged by SES's content filters will negatively affect my reputation  with SES. I'd like to implement my own content filters before needing to  hit SES. Does anyone have experience running SpamAssasin (or similar  open source offerings) for a mid-volume system like this? Any SAAS  offerings you would recommend?
3. What's  a good way to manage sending quota and rate? It's difficult to predict  what the usage will be like and I'd like to avoid long periods of  non-delivery. How can I get my allowance (preferably with cushioning)  raised before the service is open to users?
4. Any  recommendations on how I should implement search? SAAS offerings look  very expensive and I'd like to manage elasticsearch only as a last  resort. Load everything into postgres and offer full text search?  Anything else with acceptable functionality but low in development cost?
5. Setting  up inbound with SES hoists a lot of logic on to the AWS layer. Receipt  rules, SNS and S3 are forced by SES (as opposed to Postmark that offers  webhooks for inbound mail). I'd like to keep both outbound and inbound  using the same service provider but any suggestions? This isn't really a  problem per say but since this is a new project I'd like to make a good  decision.

"I'm a development manager at a medium sized company that has been using the AS/400 for over a decade now to support all of its business operations. At some point in the last 2 years, the VP decided that it was time we modernize and move onto the cloud. That's when they hired me, putting me in charge of leading that initiative.

The VP told me that he wants this done because he thought AS/400 was now obsolete, and it would become increasingly difficult to find talent.

As someone who has a lot of experience with Azure and AWS, I also thought the system was an absolute dinosaur and that it needed to go. Also, I prefer working with Azure and AWS, so that's another reason I found myself agreeing with the VP.

One year later, I'm not sure if my reasons for wanting to migrate are valid. Is the AS/400 actually obsolete? A quick google says no. Is wanting to get rid of green screens a good enough reason to migrate? I think so, but I'm not sure. Want web applications? The AS/400 can run a web server so you're covered... but that begs the question, if all we're trying to do is create web apps to run on AS/400, couldn't we just as easily host them on the cloud? If we're not writing apps in RPG or COBOL, what's the point?

Sorry if I'm all over the place here. Been struggling with this question for a while now and I can't really find answers anywhere.

"I am studying REST API architecture as I keep hearing REST APIs talked about. From what I am finding there are multiple frameworks for implementing an application with a REST API. Considering the various platforms this can be implemented on this makes sense though I am still new to the topic. Since doing research I have found websites that gives a clear outline of the concepts used and how to implement said concepts. 

I am looking to see how others have learned REST APIs and approaches when talking about the subject. 

My question is what framework is most preferred when working with a REST API? 

I am seeing mentions of frameworks such as Spring.

"I get why these licenses exists. People or organizations should not be able to clone your open source project and claim it as their own or profit from it unless you explicitly state that's allowed. But I'm totally against being able to copyright smaller pieces of code and I don't understand why everyone is all about defending this right now. Might as well just support Oracle trying to copyright an API. 

Example: I had a need to know if a given type in C# was a primitive or not so naturally I searched Google to help find a way to do that. Turns out someone had already implemented a function to do exactly what I needed but licensed it. I don't remember what type of license it was but how stupid.

If I have a single microservice with single db but two read replicas. Is 2pc applicable here?

If I have two seperate microsevices with seperate databases and functionality but one depends on another.  Both need to make changes in db successfully for transaction to be successful. Does 2pc apply here?

For eg:
Step 1 : enter amount in textbox and click submit.
Step 2 : Orders API microservice recieves it and writes it to its database. (here orders acts as co-ordinator) 
This is the prepare request. Orders MS(microservice) tells db to write the transaction but mark status as prepare??
Step 3: Orders MS calls AI MS and tells it to write transaction to its db but mark status as PREPARE??
Step4 : AI MS writes it to db and sends status code 200 back. 
Ste 5: Orders MS now updates its own db and changes status from  PREPARE to DONE 
Step 6. Orders MS now asks AI to mark transaction as Done. 
Step 7. If AI does not sends status code 200 then Orders MS updates it's row to reflect status ABORT. Then it asks  AI MS to do the same. If AI had returned 200 then Orders will mark its row as DONE and ask AI MS to do the same.

I have put together a rough DB schema that would enable us to onboard businesses and manage access to various different resources. 

My question is what changes do I have to make to the existing API to facilitate business to access our data. Can I just strap an Oauth 2.0 workflow in front of our API and let our API's be as they are.

"I recently interviewed with a company, which sells their software. I had an interview with one of the engineers and asked them: ""How do you deal with
PRs?"" The answer was along the lines of: ""We rarely do PRs, as they slow us down. We make small changes to go staring to master/main and our Cl/CD will let you know if tests don't work.""

I found this strange, as they put a lot emphasis on implementation details, memory allocation and so on. Also master/main is not released very often, but rather like 2-3 times a year.

For me, PRs are somewhat essential. Not for White spaces or any of that, but to spread knowledge and find potential issues early. I don't think 10/10 devs need to approve it, but rather a couple of people.

Leaving them out completely, or vastly, and just relaying on your CID seems a bit strange. After all, your tests are only as good as you make them.

"We're a platform team at a company with 80 devs. We run an average tech stack with Github Actions for CI, EKS, RDS, nothing fancy. We operate several applications on this system, all microservices. The clear direction from management was to build a developer platform that can help engineers self-serve stuff end to end. ""Stuff"" means:

* roll-back
* new database
* new service
* debug
* configuration management
* RBAC
* Spin up new environments etc.

Why did we decide to do this: operations were just drowning. We spent too much time on repetitive requests from developers that asked stuff in Slack or Jira Tickets. The config files (YAML and Helm) and the maintenance of many teams writing these files freestyle was just not working anymore and led to us long waiting times for everyone. We first trained people around Terraform and Helm but they just didn't want to deal with that and they ended up poking senior developers to fix things instead, which basically created a shadow operations problem on top.

Ok, so we built this platform. I think it went well, we did a good job. It's a GUI and we basically tell it ""if a developer needs an RDS of type A, this is the TF file we execute. We also set baseline YAML files, teams can apply diffs against this like a new Env Var or whatever and we compose the configurations on a deployment by deployment basis. Also takes care of Secrets etc.. Honestly, we are pretty proud of the result and does the job. Our team was excited, EMs too. We spent a lot of time explaining the platform to devs and why it's good for them i.e. they can now self-serve everything end to end without being dependent on us.

Then devs just say ""no"". There's no clear reasoning here, they don't say what is wrong or why they would refuse, they cannot point at any case that we do not cover and there is an easy and clear way of circumventing this system if you feel restricted.

So if you want to do me a favour: can you please share your experience with this stuff? My questions:

* Any idea what is going on inside the developers that makes them reject this?
* What can I do to change their perception? Change the interaction method? Explain it differently? Give them some magic feature that will swing their perception?

I'm really stuck here.","We've spent months building this platform, devs hate it, help me understand why",SoftwareEngineering

"The Gang of Four book states the following:

&gt; [...] The main relationships in MVC are given by the Observer, Composite and Strategy design patterns.

The best example of this I could find was [this][1] github repo, which shows the following class diagram:

[![enter image description here][2]][2]

I'm particularly interested in the Strategy part of the MVC, where the following holds:

| MVC Name           | GoF Name         |
|--------------------|------------------|
| View               | Context          |
| Controller         | Strategy         |
| ConcreteController | ConcreteStrategy |

Regarding the relationship between View and Controller, The book *Head First Design Patterns* states the following:

&gt; The controller may also ask the view to change. When the controller receives an action from the view, it may need to tell the view to change as a result. For example, the controller could enable or disable certain buttons or menu items in the interface

It also shows an example where the `ConcreteController` equivalent `BeatController`) defines an additional association with the `ConcreteView` equivalent (`DJView`):

```java
package headfirst.designpatterns.combined.djview;
  
public class BeatController implements ControllerInterface {
	BeatModelInterface model;
	DJView view;
   
    // BeatController implementation
}
```

This association is not present in the Strategy pattern, which only has an arrow going from `Context` to `Strategy` (and not the other way round). Furthermore, I've seen examples online which also define this association going from the controller to back to the view:

- https://sukhbinder.wordpress.com/2014/12/25/an-example-of-model-view-controller-design-pattern-with-tkinter-python/
- https://www.pythontutorial.net/tkinter/tkinter-mvc/


Is the relationship between Controller and View really only a strategy? If not what is it?

"Hello! We are a team of software engineering researchers from Eindhoven University of Technology and Sandia National Laboratories. This survey is part of a study on mentorship practices among people who develop software.

Mentorship is a process in which a more experienced or more knowledgeable person (a mentor) helps to guide a less experienced or less knowledgeable person (a mentee). Relatively little is known about the practice of mentorship within software development contexts. For that reason, we would like to ask you a few questions about what mentorship means to you and what matters most in mentoring relationships.

The survey is expected to take 10-15 minutes to complete. Only the researchers involved in this study will see your responses. Your participation in this study is voluntary. You also do not have to answer any question that makes you uncomfortable. Participants must be 18+. For questions or comments about the survey, please reach out to Dr. Reed Milewicz ([rmilewi@sandia.gov](mailto:rmilewi@sandia.gov)) or Dr. Alexander Serebrenik ([a.serebrenik@tue.nl](mailto:a.serebrenik@tue.nl)).

"**Preface:**

Stocks are traded in two ways market orders and limit orders.

* Limit Orders: are orders that have to be executed at a certain specific price only

Example : sell 10 shares of google @ $1000 , this order is stored on the orderbook ready for someone to  buy it (see below)

* Market Orders: are orders that are executed immediately at the best favorable price. In this case, if someone wants to buy 10 shares of Google, the matching algo will check the order book and find the best price e.g *10 shares of google @ $1000*  and mark it as executed (remove from order book)

**Question:**

I have seen various exchanges having extreme capabilities for order execution, some can do 100K+ orders per second. While this is impressive how is this possible?

Since all orders (both limit and market orders) coming into the matching engine have the potential to mutate the same state ( best bid and ask). *How would you scale this?  Just one big box?*

One way is to route each order based on ticker, for example, GOOG go to server1 , TSLA go to server 2

if the only way to do it is per above: 1 ticker -&gt; 1 machine, would there be a theoretical max num orders/sec based on how quickly memory can be read and written.",How to design a Stock Market Matching Engine,SoftwareEngineering

"The book *Head First Design Patterns* presents [![this UML][1]][1] as an example of the Observer pattern:

What strikes me in this diagram is the association relationship between the `Subject` and `Observer` interfaces. As far as I understand Java interfaces, they cannot implement a ""Has-a"" relationship in this way.

When I look at the implementation example provided a few pages later, I find that sure enough, the interfaces are plain old interfaces:

```
public interface Subject {
  public void registerObserver(Observer o);
  public void removeObserver(Observer o);
  public void notifyObservers;
}

public interface Observer {
  public void update(float temp, float humidity, float pressure);
}

```

Instead, the association relationship is implemented in the concrete `WeatherData` and `Display` classes:

```
public class WeatherData implements Subject {
  private List&lt;Observer&gt; observers;
  //more code
}
```

Which does not correspond to the UML and feels a bit wrong to me. Why not just implement `Subject` as an abstract class instead? Does the UML spec formalize the idea of associating an interface with another interface?

"Hey Everyone,

Just looking to get some design ideas. 

I am working on a message based system. I have a single threaded application. 

From the applications main class it can accept several messages from other applications.

MsgTypeA, MsgTypeB, MsgTypeC, MsgTypeD, MsgTypeE etc. 

From each received Message, the application must do some processing, and then call common code.

For example, after recieving MsgTypeA and MsgTypeC, a list in the class might required to be sorted.

Also, perhaps MsgTypeC and MsgTypeD both require the same response message to be sent. A Message could require multiple callback methods or none at all.

I'm trying to come up with a good design of how to handle all these common code cases that remains maintainable.

A nightmare scario is if I have all these various function calls all over the place and it becomes difficult to know what calls what.

My proposed design was to create some sort of table

\[ MsgType, HandlingFunction, CallbackFunctions...\]

Basically on recieving the message, the defined handling function is called, followed by the callback functions.

"I'm a new grad (maybe not anymore) and have 1-year of experience in IT. For the first 6 months, I was allotted to a side project in plain vanilla Java where I didn't learn much. Later I was put into manual testing for about 6 months.

Now I practiced DSA and made the switch to Dev team. I was always interested to come here. But now I am panicking. I am into the backend team where we use Azure, Docker, Java for Backend (Spring, a custom framework and a bit of Hibernate), Azure SQL and MongoDB.

I do know to code in plain Java but do not have a systemic understanding of the JVM and other things. There is a fair bit of legacy code and one week in I am not able to understand anything. I am confused about where to start looking at the codebase. I have been assigned a task and I'm afraid I won't be able to complete it within this sprint.

I need to learn the following concepts:

* **OOPS, Design Patterns, etc** (I know it on a high level but need to revisit it)
* **Core Java, Java EE and it's working** (JVM and how it works, some popular data structures I can use like ArrayList, some structures in Guava, etc)
* **Spring and Hibernate frameworks** (also need to understand why they were introduced in the first place i.e. what problem is it solving)
* **Coding standards** (like *why to use POJO*, *how to use Interfaces and abstract classes*, how to write *JUnit tests*, etc).
* Working of **Git, Maven and Gradle.**
* **REST API** (like *HTTP calls*, *authentication*, etc).
* **Multithreading and Docker** (maybe OS subject from college??)

I **used to follow YouTube courses** in college but **now feel more comfortable in reading and understanding things**. I don't know what are resources I should be referring to. So please point me to the right direction so that I can learn.

Preference would be to docs, books, blogs, etc. Also, drop-in good video courses.

I am really freaking out if I am capable enough or not (I know it's just a phase but still can't help!!). Thank You.",Help a new grad get into Java development,SoftwareEngineering

"Does anyone have a recommended way to expose business rules that do not change very frequently (let’s say 10 times a year) that are consumed by multiple different systems?

Some considerations:

-	These are rules that, by definition, do not make any external calls to get additional information to give a rule result. 
-	The rules should be able to be updated in a rather dynamic way (outside of breaking rule changes like needing a new input field or a new output field on the response).
-	A recommendation by some representatives of the calling systems was to have these rules published somewhere so that they can be cached/consumed in such a way as to not have to make HTTP calls every time these relatively static rules are needed in their application flow. These representatives however could not provide a specific solution that could facilitate this.
-	I’ve used BRMSs like Drools for externalizing business rules in the past but only for applications that I had “control” over. This use case is different in that multiple external applications on different tech stacks will be leveraging these rules 

Additional background:

-	Today, these rules are exposed as a pretty simple HTTP JSON API that takes in high-level info about a new user on request and will give back a response indicating a high-level classification of the user and what additional information needs to be collected from the user.
-	This API is useful to ensure that certain data is collected for a user upfront (while they are actively using the system) so that it does not have to be collected by a manual process later. 

For now, we will stick with our API for consumers to call these rules but I was wondering if anyone had a suggestion on a pub/sub like approach of publishing business rules for our callers to cache to minimize network calls.",Recommendations for exposing / publishing business rules,SoftwareEngineering

"# Summary
This question first uses Java examples to demonstrate what I am trying to achieve, then shows Python equivalents where I attempt to replicate the compile time behavior, but fail.

# Java

In Java, the compiler immediately throws an error if derived classes don't implement functionality required by abstract base classes or interfaces:

## Using Abstract Base Class

```java
abstract class A {
  abstract int f();
}

class B extends A {
/*
  int f(){
    return 0;
  }  
*/
}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(""done"");
  }
}

```

Comment out function `f` in class `B` definition:
 - `javac test.java` fails with `B is not abstract and does not override abstract method`
 
Uncomment function `f` in class `B` definition:
 - `javac test.java` succeeds
 
## Using Interface

```java
interface A {
  int f();
}

class B implements A {
/*
  public int f() {
    return 0;
  } 
*/
}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(""done"");
  }
}
```

Comment out function `f` in class `B` definition:
 - `javac test.java` fails with `B is not abstract and does not override abstract method`
 
Uncomment function `f` in class `B` definition:
 - `javac test.java` succeeds
 
# Python

Interfaces don't really exist in python, but they are supposed to be closely approximated by the `Protocol` class in the `typing` module. Abstract base classes do exist in the `abc` module.

What I've found, however, is that the python interpreter never complains about unimplemented behavior **unless** derived class `B` is instantiated.


## Using Abstract Base Class

```python
from abc import abstractmethod, ABC


class A(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def f(self) -&gt; int: ...

class B(A): ...

if __name__== ""__main__"":
	#b = B()
	print(""done"")
```

The following occurs if I comment out line 10:

	- `python test.py` succeeds
	- `mypy --strict test.py` succeeds
	
And the following occurs if I uncomment line 10

	- `python test.py` fails with `TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class B with abstract method f`
	- `mypy --strict test.py` fails with `Cannot instantiate abstract class ""B"" with abstract attribute ""f""`


## Using Protocol

```python
from typing import Protocol
from abc import abstractmethod

class A(Protocol):
    @abstractmethod
    def f(self) -&gt; int: ...

class B(A): ...

if __name__==""__main__"":
  b = B()
  print(""done"")
```

Just like with an abstract base class, the following occurs if I comment out line 10:

	- `python test.py` succeeds
	- `mypy --strict test.py` succeeds
	
And the following occurs if I uncomment line 10

	- `python test.py` fails with `TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class B with abstract method f`
	- `mypy --strict test.py` fails with `Cannot instantiate abstract class ""B"" with abstract attribute ""f""`

# Question

I am not always instantiating the necessary classes which implement protocols or extend abc's in python. So I would like to mimic ""compile"" time interfaces in python, preferrably with `mypy`.

"We just had an incident where all of our builds suddenly started failing because each build downloads the latest version of one of the libraries from the developer web site, and builds against that, and it turns out we're incompatible with the version they released today. This is not the first time this has happened. One time, the upstream upgrade happened after we'd finished the bulk of our testing, and we didn't notice it was broken until after we'd shipped to customers.

This seems like a problem, but I've not been able to persuade any managers that it's maybe worth our product build not depending on random internet systems we haven't audited and have no control over. Most of my previous jobs have been at much smaller companies, and that's always been pretty routine, but it's apparently unrealistic in bigger products (\~billion dollars a year of revenue, a couple of hundred engineers, eight year old project)?

"Hi, 
I’m currently working as a frontend engineer with some years of experience, and while I do pick up a few things from my daily work, it’s still just basically writing some React code, CSS, and so on. So I’m getting the feeling of falling behind for a bit. Some shiny topics have come up recently, of which I have some basic high end knowledge but looking to learn about them more in-depth. These, for example, include:
- Micro-frontends 
- PWAs
- Static site generation
…
etc.

I’m not looking for technology specific knowledge, but rather trends/topics in the field itself. The field is getting very competitive and it’s all about having an edge now.
Also open for general not-frontend-specific software engineering and architecture topics.

With that mind, can someone suggest books that could help in that area?

Thanks",Software engineering books to read in 2022,SoftwareEngineering

"I am working on a project which we got from vendor and the project right now is just imperative with so much tight coupling and no clean code practices.

Now we are thinking to reengineer complete application and thinking to have DDD approach with event driven architecture.

I want to know how do we handle situation where one transaction depends upon the other

**For example**

We have one billing service and other inventory

During billing retailer first selects or add a new customer and then finds a product and if not found create one for his inventory and then that product is available for billing to customers .

So here we have four services customer, billing and inventory, notofocation

As of now we have backend logic sth like this

    import {addCustomer, findCustomer } from './addCustomer'; 
    import {addProductToInventory, findProductInInventory} from './addProductToInventory'; 
    import {notification } from './notificationService'; 
    import {createBill, generateInvoice } from './billingService';  
    const makeBill = async (req, res) =&gt; 
    { 
      let {customer, inventoryProducts, billData} = req.body;    
       const customerId = await findCustomer(customer);   
         if(!customerId){     
           customerId = await addCustomer(customer)   
         }
      inventoryProducts.forEach( product =&gt; {     
            const productId = await findProductInInventory(product);     
            if(!productId){        
                 productId = await addProductToInventory(product);
            }
         }   
    
     let billId = await createBill(customerId, productId, billData);  
      await generateInvoice(billId, billData);  
      notification(billId, billData, userData);     
    return; 
    } 

**If we use some event store and store all the transactions states, How can we handle event if each process depends upon another unless we know the transaction happened ?**

*Note: This is just example of process right now, its is not the implementation of domains, just wanted to know how event driven will work in such situations*",How can I make my nodejs application event driven if the actions depends upon each other,SoftwareEngineering
